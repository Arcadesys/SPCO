## Addie, 2020

Our official plurality journey began with pizza during the pandemic.

COVID was at a lull in August of 2020, and restraints on gathering loosened for a brief summer window while cases were low. Importantly, _people could go out to eat_. After months of being cooped up in our Chicago condo we were desperate for any hint of normality, so we jumped on the chance to get pizza at our favorite Chicago tavern. 

It had been a hot summer, and we'd spent it swimming in the lake as well as doing a lot of work on ourselves. Gone were the long nights of drinking, replaced with a healthy diet and more early morning activities. I was in the best shape of my adult life after a half-year of working with a personal trainer. The suicidal ideation was gone, replaced with morning meditations, tea, and a deep feeling of being _centered_ that I had never felt before.

The area we lived in bristled with residential high-rises, mom and pop restaurants, and families living out their lives in middle-income housing. It was the sort of community that pulls you in deep and *forces* you to care; where your neighbors were the same people who served you at the pub, or the ones who ran the register at the small grocer nearby, or lived in your building. It was home, in a way that I had never experienced before.

Safe. _I was safe._

As we walked to the tavern my mind drifted back to memories of my transition. I had lost my job due to a layoff and had just enough money to pay for next month's rent. I had a religious experience in that moment: a guardian spirit assured me things would be okay and started taking over my body. She helped me find a new job, scrap to start my career, and navigate being estranged from my family.  

Yep. You heard that right. Guardian Angel. Her name was Tally, and she saved my life.

A chilly breeze blasted us with the smells of the lake as we moved between high-rises. So yes, when my dysphoria was at its worst and I was ready to give up and die I was, quite literally, possessed by the spirit to survive.

I cannot overstate this; I'd wanted to kill myself since I was about 13, and every single day I didn't attempt was a blessing. Having Tally believe in me, holding my hand through the toughest two years of my life, saved me. I would have died without her, easily.

Back in the real world the traffic light changed and we crossed the four-lane street. I squeezed D's hand and then, without meaning to, words started coming from my mouth:

"Remember the spirit I told you about?"

There it was, that "I'm no longer in control" feeling. Saying the words felt... Involuntary? Compelled? Puppeted? I didn’t want to talk but there I was, talking anyway. That happened to me a lot when I was young: words would just come out of my mouth before my brain thought through them, and then I’d get in trouble for it. I could never remember little outbursts, come to think of it. 

But this? This feeling of _watching_ as my body went through the motions? This was different.

My “lips moved without my will. “Yeah. Tally. The one that did transition for me."

"The fox spirit that took control of your body for a while?"

"Yeah. That one."

We had talked about this at some point. I had long since chalked it up to either a spiritual experience or a mental break. Either way, it was in the past. 

“I thought she was gone.”

My head felt fuzzy, disconnected. I wanted to wake up.

_This wasn't supposed to happen anymore._

I watched my body cross the street, turn to D, and flash them a bright smile. “Surprise, she’s still here!”

D leaned on my shoulder. After five years of marriage we still acted like newlyweds, all playful and affectionate and such. We'd been through a lot together; the death of their father, panic attacks, depression, layoffs, and we got through by being each other's cheerleader. Our first date was seeing "Silver Linings Playbook" and spending the walk home talking about our traumas and our mental illnesses, so we took mental health pretty seriously in this house.

“That’s neat,” they said.

I noticed, as they grabbed my arm, just how much stronger they had gotten in the past three months. We had spent that time working through their gender. They started low dose testosterone a few months ago and just... gosh. They _blossomed_. Between their transition and my work to recover from the attempt in 2019 we were closer than ever.

For a brief moment I could move my mouth. And in a panic, I tried to tell D I was not okay. But all that came out was her voice, her choices, her _will._

“I don’t know what this means,” I managed, and then I lost control again.

“Who knows?” They looked to the sky for a moment. "I wish I could thank her for keeping you safe back then."

Words just spilled out of me. "Well, you're in luck then."

Their eyes widened. "Really? I thought she went away in 2011."

"I did, yeah. But I like to check in from time to time."

D stopped to meet my eyes.

"Tally?"

"Speaking!"

This was about the point where my memory faded out. Like, I remembered walking two blocks, the pizza we ate, the cosmo Tally ordered. But the memory was all fuzzy. Imagine trying to watch a scrambled porn channel in a hotel room and trying to make sense of what you were seeing. It was sort of like that; I knew things happened, but they didn't happen to *me*.

Guess I have to pass this over to Tally to finish, then.

## Tally, 2020

To begin with, I’m surprised I didn't go on a date with D earlier.

I'd poked my nose in to check on Addie from time to time, and I'd spoken to D a few times in the past without them knowing. But the idea of going out for dinner and a drink just never occurred to me until Addie started to get off the sauce. She's a bit of an anxious worrywort and never liked interventions, so I never tried before.

Now, though? Addie was safe. It was okay for me to give her a gentle push.

We arrived at the tiny tavern to a hero’s welcome. Gino's North was our local haunt pre-pandemic. It was this little shotgun bar that sat 10 to 20 people, tops, and stayed alive on the strength of their grandmother’s pizza recipe. Old gays owned the place and decorated it with plenty of camp and charm; local artists' work dotted the walls, and a giant faux marble statue of a nude woman stood sentinel over the bar. This place was so important to us that we made a point during the pandemic to order delivery from them every week to help keep them alive when restaurants and offices were closed down. It was the sort of place you expect to see in a sitcom: everyone knows your name, your hobbies, and your favorite orders, and nobody gets mean with that information.

We settled into one of four round booths beside the bar. Plexiglass surrounded us on two sides, but that didn't bother me at all. It was just nice to be up in the front and, well, _existing_. I know that's odd to say but that's exactly how I felt. A few moments ago it was 2008, and now it’s 2020.

(This is a completely and totally normal human experience, right? Anybody?)

The bartender brought water over. We made small talk from behind our masks for a moment, and I pretended to be Addie, the “normal” one, so nobody would catch wise.

"I didn't realize you came back," D said in a hushed voice. They had this gobsmacked look in their eyes that just made them look cute as a button.

I guess it's not every day your spouse blinks and becomes a completely different person, but they sure were along for the ride.

"Well, sweetheart, I never went away. Just went quiet for a little while."

"You've never talked to me before, though."

I chuckled. "Okay, a _long_ while. But I'm here now! You wanted to thank me, right? Let's get drinks first. You know, I've never had a drink in my life and Austen says the drinks here are great!"

That was Addie's name back before system discovery. Austen. The body's name. Poor dear didn't realize we existed back then, even though she'd experienced actual freaking multiplicity in her past. Stubborn one, her. We collectively decided she had to change her name so that no one alter was so important that they got to use “our” name.

It’s weird, I know. But that’s how our brain works.

"Yeah... uh, right. Thank you! Let's do that.” We waved down the server. I ordered a cosmo. Not sure why; Addie never really liked them to start with. Maybe it was the rom-coms I watched while Addie and I shared a body at the start of our transition. The ladies in those films loved ordering cosmos, and I was a lady, so a cosmo it was.

I ran my finger over the rim of the glass and flashed a wicked smile. "You should know that Addie is watching over my shoulder and is just fit to be tied!"

"Thanks for keeping them alive," D said. We toasted and took a sip. Turns out, not a bad idea ordering that cosmo. Real tasty.

"It was nothing. Couldn't have them hurting the body we share, after all."

"What brings you back?"

I put down the drink. "They're ready to know about us."

That caught D by surprise. I folded my hands and waited for them to process.

"Us?"

"Yep. _Us_."

"You can't be serious."

"Things are going to get rocky," I said as I tapped my forehead. "Up here, that is. But I know they're gonna get through it as a team. Doubly so with someone like you at their side."

The air felt thick and time slowed to a crawl. We sat in that silence for what felt like forever.

"That's a lot to take in," D said.

"They have no idea what's coming," I said, "and they're going to need you."

"Of course! I love you. …uh, them.”

"We made the best choices," I grasped their hands. "Meeting you, marrying you, and loving you. It's all gonna be okay. Promise. May just be a while before we get there."

"Sure thing," D said. “But first, pizza.”

## Addie, 2020

The L train rumbled overhead. College kids chatted about partying as they passed us on the sidewalk. High rises surrounded us on all sides, as if the city was a gigantic cradle holding us in safety.

I came to as we walked home. It's... hard to explain with words. It feels like a flashbulb firing in your head, or like waking up from a light nap. I knew that we just had dinner and yet when I tried to recall details about the past hour the memories slipped out of my fingers.

D squeezed my hand. I felt tipsy, and then memories of cocktails flooded my brain. Gauging by their wide smile and silly stride they were solidly in the pocket too. 

"Tell Tally I said thanks," D said. "It was nice meeting her."

"Tally, huh? She hasn't been around in ages—"

That was the moment I felt her presence inside. Warm, calming, motherly in its own way. I swear to you, I could feel her hand on my shoulder, her breath on my neck. Images of calm forests and night skies flooded my brain. For the first time in a decade, Tally was back.

_Tally was back._

"Holy shit."

D and I rounded the street corner in silence. Inside, however, it was a joyous reunion. I imagined myself hugging Tally, her warmth enveloping my body. She smelled of lavender. She was... blonde, I think. Milky skin. Green eyes. Two giant fox ears on top of her head, and a tail that wrapped around me as we hugged.

D turned to me. "You okay?"

"I thought you were gone," I said. D shot me a look but the words weren’t meant for them.

I could hear Tally’s laughter in my head. "You don't have to talk to me out loud. You remember that much, right?"

I pursed my lips and, uh, pushed my voice inward. Sorry. There's no good way to describe that without seeming like you've got a screw loose, is there? I was talking to someone inside my head, and they were talking right back to me. Totally normal.

I thought, "Uh. Yeah. Right. It's been forever, hasn't it?"

Tally flashed an image of her stern face in my head. "You said you didn't need me anymore, so I left."

"Oh."

She crossed her arms. "Yeah. *Oh.*”

"Still with me, Austen?" The world snapped into too-sharp focus. D and I were walking into our condo's lobby. They had both of my hands in theirs and a worried look on their face.

"I think so."

"Looked like nobody was home for a second there."

"I'm... gosh. I can't believe I"m saying this, but I'm talking to Tally.”

“I know, hon.” they smiled. “Everything okay?"

"Better than okay," I said. "Everything is wonderful!"

"I'll leave you two to it, then."

The world fell out of focus again and I found myself with Tally. I swear to you, I wanted to break into tears right there and then. She was back! My friend, my protector, my other half... Finally, we were whole again!

I imagined holding her hands in mine as we danced to the music of angels.

"I'm so sorry, Tally.”

"I know." Her voice came in stronger this time: angelic, mysterious, a little breathy. “Just leave it to me. I can get us through this year but you have to let me in and trust me. It's sort of like puppetry—“

“Yes.” I interrupted her. “Whatever it is, yes. Anything for you. I would have died without you."

"_We_ would have died, Addie. But here you are, good job, amazing spouse, house. Not a bad way to run a railroad if you ask me."

For a moment I couldn't speak, couldn't move, couldn't take my eyes off her. I wanted this image burned into my memory, and if I didn’t focus hard enough the memory will slip away. And just... gosh. I missed this. Feeling her presence, knowing that someone else was in my head, watching out for me even in my darkest moments.

Tally pulled away from my grasp. "You're doing great. I just wanted to hang back long enough to say that to you. Spare me a thought every once in a while, eh?"

I rushed back into arms and buried my face in her shoulder. I felt her hug me back, her thoughts filling full of lavender, fresh spring dew, fireflies blinking in the dusk.

"I wish you wouldn't go."

“Addie—“

“_Please. Please, for the love of the gods and all that is good in this world, don't go._”

She pinched my cheek. "Oh, Addie, I’m not going anywhere. You're stuck with me! Besides, I don't think you'll ever be alone in here again."

"Come again?"

"Spoilers," she said. With a snap of her fingers I catapulted back into the real world. 

I came to with my body tucked into bed, but I felt Tally laying right there beside me, her hands stroking my hair until I went to sleep.


## Twi, 2020

This is going to sound strange, but it's a lot easier for me to spill my guts to random people on the internet than it is for me to confide in friends. Between that longstanding quirk and not knowing any plural people at the time, I threw a hail mary of an ask to every nerd I knew:

"Hey folks, I'm not doing well lately. Like, really not well. So I'm trying something I'm usually very bad at: asking for support.

"Without going into the nitty gritty (and a wall of text), I'm dealing with some pretty nasty dissociative disorder issues that flared up in the past month. Specifically, I've gone from having a single person in my head (completely normal, I think!) to having, uh, six people in my head, give or take, depending on the day.”

(I stopped mid-word while typing the message. Six? _Six?_ It was three this morning!)

“This is causing me problems like dissociative meltdowns (where I just sort of, uh, shut down for a minute or two), panic attacks, and amnesia when a head-mate decides to ‘switch’ in and take over the body. Overall, it's a good step toward healing, as those head-mates have memories and skills that I usually don't have access to, but it doesn't change the fact that this is some scary-ass shit.

"Some folks here already know what's going on, and they've been lovely in supporting me. But it's a lot. I'd love to say that I'm handling it like a champ but I'm not. I'm white-knuckling my way through my days and feeling pretty scared about what the future holds, given these issues. 

“I’m the kind of person who takes pride in having their shit together and having a good memory, two things that are definitely not happening when six different people are trying to be a complete, single person. (That it's starting to affect my job performance is definitely not helping matters either.)

"I know times are tough right now for everyone, mental health wise, but any kind words, love, or support you have to spare would be very much appreciated right now. I also feel better when I'm helping others, so if there's anything you need to unload, problems you need help solving, or issues I can help fix, please reach out. \<3

"...and please feel free to ask questions, here or in DMs. Talking about the specifics of it makes it feel less scary, oddly enough."

Our friends showed up for us and put us in touch with people in the plural community.

I know, I know, that shouldn't be shocking. Giving a shit is table stakes in a friendship, but there I was, feeling relief and overwhelming gratitude that the people in my life took the time to care for me.

You’d almost think I was worth loving, given how they all came through!

## Addie, 2020

We can’t ignore the elephant in the room: 2020 was a very, very important presidential year. As a trans woman in a lesbian marriage, I was terrified. Politics used to be fun, but this felt existential; that if something didn’t change, my way of life was going to be on the chopping block. The one thing I want most in this world is for the election to be over.

Waking up those days started with a long bout of news: Washington Post, The Bulwark, Twitter. Click all the links around election coverage. A half hour would pass and then I’d roll out of bed. We hadn't kept up on chores for a few weeks now; doing anything other than working and living was just impossible.

No clothes. I sniffed t-shirts from the hamper. "Four more days," I said. D stirred in their bed. "That's all we have to survive before election day. Then this whole mess will be over."

"Here's hoping,” D said. “By the way, you left a note to yourself last night.”

Taped to my computer monitor was a note card in someone else’s handwriting.

"Check your videos."

“I didn’t write this.”

D shrugged. “Well, one of you did." They busied themselves with getting dressed for their court call in what we called our “pandemic mullet”: tank top, lawyerly blazer, and pajama pants. I worked in IT project management but dressed mostly the same: professional on top, pajamas on bottom.

"I don't remember writing this."

“You do.”

Another voice in my head. I was getting used to hearing them by that point. Mostly it was Tally inside, yammering away, but sometimes I'd hear different voices. Some whispered. Others screamed. Some cried. But when I felt like I was losing my cool the voices would die down and Tally would be right there, ready to calm me.

D leaned back into the room as they threw on their blazer. "Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just... you know."

I tapped my temple, twirled my finger to sign "crazy", and rolled my eyes.

"I see," D said. "Well, make sure they make you eat breakfast." They disappeared downstairs to start their court call, and in the silence Tally hummed a little tune that I swear I could hear in the real world.

She clucked our tongue. “You don't have to be mean to me,” I… I mean Tally said. The mouth wasn’t mine to use in right now.

"What?" I thought.

“Like what you’re experiencing isn’t real.”

“It’s not that.”

“No. You want some logical rationalization so that you can convince yourself I’m not real. That way, you can dismiss me.”

“Where is this coming from?”

Tally did her best impersonation of my voice. “I’m crazy, and if I’m crazy no one will love me! But people do love me, which means I can’t possibly be crazy. Ergo, I can just ignore the voice _literally taking control of my body_ like it’s no big deal.

She grinned. “Did I get close?”

I wanted to tell her to fuck off but I still didn’t have control of my mouth. A quick look at the clock told me I was too late to make tea, or meditate, or any of the good live/laugh/love bullshit habits I’d been working on over the past few months.

So before I could get lost in the despair of being a legitimately crazy person, I put on a face and went to work.

On went the work laptop; I went about logging in and joining my first meeting of the day. When you do Agile project management your day is just meetings upon meetings, and today was supposed to be no different. Four hours of meetings in the morning, two in the afternoon, and four hours of paperwork to fill out before I could relax tonight.

I watched my team give project updates through Zoom. Then, without warning, their voices went fuzzy. I looked to the post-it note again and, without thinking, picked it up.

“You need to watch this video,” Tally said.

“I hate when you do that,” I said.

“Do what?”

“Control my arm like that. it feels creepy.”

She tutted. “You used to think it was a cool superpower.”

“That was before I had a job I had to focus on. This is a huge opportunity for me, you know? If I do this right I can become an Agile Coach full time!”

The meeting had gone quiet, but I was too busy arguing with a voice in my head to notice. 

“—Austen?”

The world snapped back into focus.

You ever have that dream where you’re taking a test and you can’t remember any of the answers? Well, I lived that dream every time this happened. Panic gripped my throat. I wanted to apologize, disconnect from the meeting, run, and hide under my covers, I was so scared.

“I’m sorry,” I said, flustered. I fought the instinct to run and hide. “Uh, I was multitasking. Come back to me in a minute?”

“Sure thing,” a coworker said, and then I smashed the mute button.

I placed the note back on the monitor bezel. “I told you I’d look at this later. Four more days, I promise.”

“When you're not a nervous wreck about the election?”

“Well, yeah. I’m too busy to have a breakdown right now, Tally. We both know that. Just let me push it down a little longer.”

For a moment there was quiet - blessed, beautiful quiet! Then her voice boomed in my ear: “Nope. you said that in 2008. Never again. I’m putting my foot down.”

My hands moved outside of my control. I shut down the work laptop. Turned off the monitor. Then, my hand reached for the phone and pulled up my photo library.

Inside were a half-dozen videos of myself that I had no memory of creating. Weirder still, none of those videos were made by *me* Sure, it was my body in the frame, and my mouth making the sounds, but something was off. One version of myself in the phone had a gentle voice, a feminine "pop" to their hips, and a warm smile that I swear to you, had you paid me a hundred dollars on the spot to replicate it, I couldn't. In another video we used a male voice that we hadn’t attempted in 12 years. Another one was my body, but it looked like it was shot by a five year old; their twinkling, bright eyes and a wide smile belied a playful, childish innocence.

Each video had the same message:

"You're doomscrolling again," the video said, and immediately I wanted to turn it off.

I didn’t remember doing this. Oh gosh, I don't remember this at all. It's me-but-not-me in the video and I'm talking to myself and this is how it ends, isn't it, when I finally crack and go crazy like I always knew would happen. After years of fighting off the insanity this was the straw that'd break everything and...

Wait, I _quit the meeting?_ Gods, I have to go back right now—

Tally’s soothing voice echoed in my ear. “Please, Stop doing that. Take a breath. Relax. I'm trying to help you, Addie. How does your chest feel?”

My shoulders relaxed. I put one hand to my heart as the other pressed the pause button on the video. My breaths were shallow and fast; my heart pounded loudly enough to drown out the background noise around me.

“You're having a panic attack, friend. Remember what your therapist says? ‘Ride the wave.’ You're going to be fine.”

I breathed until I didn’t feel dizzy anymore and restarted the videos.

The not-mes smiled and flashed warm, empathetic, confident eyes in the videos. It was almost like they were, well, _concerned_. Which didn’t make sense; who in the hell shoots a video of themselves to stage an intervention—

…oh no.

Another voice: this one husky, feminine, but familiar. I’d used it for a few months in 2016 when I had a hard butch phase. “The election will happen no matter how you end up feeling about it. Also hello, this is what it looks like when Max fronts."

I felt terror well up in my heart. why was I doing this? Surely it was an act. All I had to do was assert my will hard enough. Tell the voices in my head to buzz off. Concentrate really hard on bottling up the feelings welling up in me: terror, anger, frustration, grief, the whole lot.

“What is all this?” I hissed. I wanted to delete it all and throw the phone away, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

“I’d like to wake up now,” I said, but the words wouldn’t leave my lips.

Tally rooted through my phone. She went on a application deleting spree: Twitter, Facebook, my news aggregators. Anything I could use to obsess about the election, Tally nuked it from the phone.

"You need to take a break," she said, using my mouth to say it. "For all our sakes, you need to give us some control. The more you fight, the worse this will get."

I felt terrified, powerless, and humbled, all in equal measure. So I gave up fighting as the body went about de-politicizing my life.

“You’re going on a social media diet. No more doomscrolling. No more dancing around the facts of your brain. There’s a lot of us in here, and you’re going to learn to deal with that.”

“I have a therapist.” I said. For a moment I looked back to the work laptop and willed myself, with every fiber of my being, to jump back on the work call. I might as well have tried to move the Earth itself.

"You need to tell him about us. Today. Either do it at your pace, or I'll get it done for you right now.”

She pulled up my therapist’s number.

“Your choice.”

Then: vertigo, disorientation, the fulttering of eyelashes and the panic of possibly passing out.

I woke up. Again.

My hands were back under my own control. I turned them around to inspect them closely, making sure I wasn't dreaming. My mind felt clean - too clean, as if I had forgotten something very important that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

“Glad to see you getting the point,” Tally said. “Now take the day off. we’re getting you an emergency session.”

## Joey (or one of us)?
\<Something here about that emergency sesion.
“I have not done this before. But we’re gonna get through it.”

## Addie 2020

I didn’t just rely on a therapist.

My entire life, up to that point, had been shaped by the kindness of internet strangers. I learned to write by way of a Tennessee autoworker who published science fiction. I cut my teeth writing for strangers on the internet, taking and giving praise for the stories we wrote together. Even now, 30 years later, I still keep in contact with many of the folks I met there, and when times get tough I still look to them for support.

The plural community, as it turns out, was no different.

The Great Cats System was one of the first systems to help us figure out being plural, and honestly their collective help saved our life. We spent days chatting with them over Telegram and for the longest time I only knew their face by the ever-changing, furry avatar picture that represented who I was talking to. But the intensity of their attention, the obvious love and empathy they put into every person they helped, and the way their experience of DID matched up with the way we experienced it kept me coming back every minute of every day, hanging onto any advice they could give me.

They were the first system I really got to know in detail, and let me tell you the experience of beeing seen like that was liquid lightning in my veins. In those early conversations my memory felt like swiss cheese, and scrolling back through the timeline would leave me scratching my head as to who wrote our responses. She assured us that all was well, and that this was part of the process.

It didn't take her long to prescribe a fix for my problems: "You need to take a vacation, Addie."

"I don't have PTO," I replied.

"No. _You_, Addie. You need to take some time away from the front."

I'd made a study of all the lingo: switching, co-consciousness, littles, trauma holders, protectors, persecutors... not that I knew how to identify them inside my own head, that is, but I tried anyway. Inside was always radio silence.

"You need to let someone else front. The election is driving you up a wall."

"I don't know how."

"Ask inside. _Nicely_ ask inside, I mean. Open yourself up to them."

"Okay."

"Tell them you want to switch out," she texted, but before I could respond the world fell out of focus again.


---- 


I came to months later.

D and I were seated at a local brunch place's patio, champagne flutes in our hands. People shouted and cheered from their balconies. Every passing car honked their horn. Some even unfurled an American flag and blasted Bon Jovi over their car stereos. The owner of the joint walked around and clinked glasses with every patron.

D must have noticed me spacing out and took my free hand into theirs. "Hi! Who's this?"

“It’s Addie. Why am I out here?"

"It's November 7," D said. "The election was called. Biden won. We're gonna finish brunch and go to Boystown. Remember?"

"No?"

"It's fine. Tally said that might happen.” D raised their glass to me. “To this whole mess being over.”

“To new beginnings,” I replied, and we clinked glasses.

## Tally, 2020

Addie sat cross-legged on the beige carpet of our guest bedroom, breathing slowly, deliberately. The real world melted and she found herself staring at a barren expanse, darkness as far as the eye could see.

"So now what, Tally? This seems so silly."

"Hush! It's visualization. We need a way to talk to each other inside."

"I can hear you just fine."

"We need _something_. Like... like a talisman, you know? Something to help us conceive of _us_ Something comfortable. Something safe."

"The arcade."

My ears perked. "Okay, you have my attention. Go on."

"Well, I remember loving the arcade growing up. There was this one near us called Putt Putt. The one on Washington Street? Our uncle took us there on Saturdays for golf and go-karting. And when we were in that space, no matter who was with us, nothing bad happened to us, right?"

I smiled at her. “Because lots of kids plus lots of adults means lots of witnesses..."

"Exactly."

I put a finger to my chin and considered talking more about the uncle. No. Not yet.

“Love the energy, Addie. But let’s pick something more recent, maybe?”

“Okay.” She snapped her fingers. “Logan Arcade. We've been there, what, twice a month for the past five years to play in that pinball league? I bet we could remember every twist of that place if we needed to."

I raised my hands and well-worn wood flooring rose up to meet us. Above, pressed tin ceiling tiles fell into place with an audible clack. Brick rose from the void to define the walls. Small lights twinkled in the ceiling, and from the floor dozens of pinball machines rose into existence. Jake Shears played over the sound system and for a moment the stress and trauma that formed the background noise of our collective life gave way to simple, straightforward bliss.

I prodded Addie further. “Okay. What do we _need_ out of this place? Far as I'm concerned, we need a way to know who is driving the body, some places to represent being not in front, and a place to help everyone sleep. Thoughts?"

"Well, there's these double doors in the back we can use for the front. Throw up a control panel there - something with multiple joysticks and buttons and stuff—“

"—Inside Out style!"

The fronting room came into focus. To the rear, a double-door exit opened to an alley slick with rain. Across the street there was a drive-in projector screen that showed what the body's eyes saw. On one wall, we placed a low-slung leather sectional with a good view of the same screen. Pinball machines lined the other wall. Through an archway was a dark room lined with old coin-ops, and past that a dark, homey bar was bracketed by more pinball machines, an antique coke machine, and Chicago windows that looked out on a rain-slick city street.

“You can’t go back from this,” I told her.

“From what?”

“This is like hanging a giant ‘OPEN’ sign inside your head. I don’t know who will come, or how many there will be. Just… Look.” I pinched my brow.

“Something may go wrong.”

“Can’t be wrong,” Addie replied. She put a hand to my cheek. “I’m here with you.”

“Softie.” Laughing, I nudged Addie toward a cord attached to a large "OPEN" sign that sat in the window. "Want to do the honors?"

"Sure." Their finger touched the cord and then froze. They looked back. Swallowed a lump in their throat.

Addie flicked on the light. Cool blue and firey red neon shot out through the darkness. There was silence for a moment, but then a strong breeze threw open the door. Dozens of shadows - nothing more than eyes and soot and dust bunnies! - flooded into the arcade!

“There’s so many!”

“Yes!” I said. “We’re open for business!”

The sound of dozens of coin-ops and pinball machines spinning up buffeted us in a sweet symphony of chiptunes, chimes, and home.

I typed my first post into the system chat: “Okay."

Someone in my head set up a system communication channel for us on the suggestion of some folks I followed on Twitter. I found it on my computer the day after the election call, and something inside me compelled me to click and write something. "Okay" was the best I could do.

My fingers started typing. A bot on the server proxied my message with custom avatars representing my alters. Tally’s avatar on the chat was a little cartoon fox we had picked off the internet.

I used a selfie.

Tally typed: “Okay? Just okay?"

"You win. This is real. There's more than one of us."

I expected anxiety. Fear, shock, something to prove to me that I had finally lost the last of my marbles. Instead, I felt a sense of calm. My shoulders relaxed and for the first time in a long, long while I felt like myself. Comfortable. _Whole._

"What happens now?"

My fingers danced across the keyboard. "We get to know our neighbors. Hang out at the arcade. Ask questions. Be curious.”

“That sounds crazy.”
  
“That’s because we are,” Tally typed back, ending the message with a \<3 for extra sass.

## Addie, 2020

I was still waiting for a call from my family.

It had been a month since my first phone call with my sister and the silence was killing me. What surprised me was how desperately I wanted to see this man pay. Like, river-of-fire hatred of the man. It felt out of place, given the circumstances. Shouldn’t a good child support the family through this rough time? Offer solace and a neutral shoulder to lean on whenever it’s needed?

Instead, the fire raged on and on. All I could do was focus on putting out the brightest flames.

“You know what they’re going to say,” D warned us.

“But maybe this time will be different,” Lucy said, and I imagined her holding up the football to yank away again. “The stakes are higher now.”

I picked up the phone and rang my sister. She answered quickly.

“How the hell are you?”

“On tetherhooks. You told me last month dad was facing some serious trouble. What came of it?”

“Oh, your niece was just complaining about him,” she said.

I knew that lawyers had been called, and that the whole trouble started from a therapist’s mandatory report, but I still couldn’t find the stomach to contradict my sister.

“She made it all up.”

“Wait, everything blew over? He was accused of molesting a kid! He’s got a proven track record of assaulting women! How in the world does that all blow over?”

“She just doesn’t come around anymore,” she said. “When the family gets together, she stays home.”

The casual tone of her voice filled me with rage, and we bubbled over.

“I’m sorry, but this is in direct contradiction to what you said a month ago. You were on board with him getting his due karma. Now you’re suddenly parroting everything he says.”

“I never said that.”

“You did. I took notes.”

I could hear the surprise in her voice. “That’s weird. That’s why you don’t get to be with the family anymore.”

That’s the thing that drives me bonkers about my sister; no matter how sincere she sounds on one day, you could never expect what she’d say next. Usually it was parroting whatever line she heard last, far as I could tell, and the last person who got to her was my father.

“You still hate us for not being perfect about your transition.”

“That’s not true.”

“But it is. You refuse to come over. You hate us.“

“You’ve never once visited me in Chicago,” I replied, but that wasn’t going to be enough.

“I just wish you’d come around and stop being angry. It’s a shame that my kids won’t know their aunt because of misunderstandings like this.”

There was no reason to continue this conversation. Dad had gotten to her, and everyone was going to parrot the same answer.

“Why do you hate us so much?”

I wanted to lay it all out for her. To explain just how much being rejected for being trans hurt. About learning that being present was dangerous before the age of three. That all of the insults and anger over the years had ground me down to a smooth, round ball of a person who couldn’t get any emotional connection to the folks that hurt us. For the kid who wanted exactly one thing in the entire world - to be a girl - but couldn’t admit it for fear of being caught and sent to a straight camp.

But instead, all I could muster was resignation. “I… Sure. Yeah.”

“Can we put this behind us?”

“Sure,” I said, and promptly changed the subject to something small and Midwestern to end the meat of the conversation.

“How’d it go?” D asked.

“I don’t know why I bothered,” I replied.

Why would we write such an ugly book, you may ask? Because I need you to see this. To hear this. To know I am seen, and believed, and loved despite of all of it. I want you to feel what it’s like to be that little kid, barely out of diapers, who could not speak and had already learned that being present in the world was something to be feared. I want her - all of the little girls and boys in the system! - to know that they are loved, heard, and believed.

That is the most important thing I know on Earth, and all I need to know.
