Things didn’t get better after we returned to Chicago.

There was usually this “game face” we could put on to get through stressful times, a way to cut off the emotions at the root to survive. But this memory, these kids? They felt like a gaping wound, bleeding the will to live right out of me. I would lay down to sleep and have flashbacks, get up and have flashbacks, sit the wrong way and have flashbacks… basically, if i was awake and not totally in control of my environment, flashbacks happened.

I started isolating from everyone and everything. Most days were spent dissociating and watching YouTube. Sometimes I didn’t even leave the bed, choosing instead to lay and wallow in misery. I forgot to eat on many days, and D was sure to point it out when they saw it. But then, well, I started hiding.

“I’m fine,” I said, convinced that my poker face would cover up my puffy eyes and dead stare.

“It’s just tough,” I said, trying to distract myself from thinking through yet another plan to unalive myself.

Then, to top it all off, I woke up one September day with a herniated disc. Standing was impossible, sitting was painful, and every step I took was like pouring fire down my leg. I knew how to solve it - walk until it feels better - but in the interim I spent most of my days laying on the floor. I’d piled up some pillows and an iPad onto a yoga mat to keep busy since everything I wanted to do required standing, sitting, or otherwise not this super comfortable prone position.

Existing was pain. Laying down and doing nothing helped, but in that big expanse of “nothing” was a nonstop barrage of painful memories, smiling men with sweaty hair, wet spots on the bed—

Listening inside I heard crying. My body began to shake as the men with sweaty hair told me how good a boy I was.  

“I need ice, hon.” But D already knew. I was always the last to know I was in active crisis, it seemed. Didn’t matter how much mindfulness work I did, or how much I tracked my emotions, every other person in a room with me would know I was in the middle of a meltdown.          

I breathed, and grounded. D pushed the ice to my wrist and I gasped. A switch. Adult. “Thanks,” they said, and we tried to settle back down in a way that wasn’t painful, both mentally and physically.

I felt tired. Tired of my little condo, tired of work, tired of hurting, tired of… well, everything! If it wasn’t work it was therapy, or doctor’s appointments, or worst of all the nights I fell into a bottle to escape the pain and memories.

Flashbacks became more intense. I would be fine one second, and then come to twenty minutes later, laying on the ground and humping the air, tears piling up on the living room rug. I lost count of the number of kids who came out around this time, but we decided that after 100 alters it was best to stop trying to keep score.                  

I was definitely suicidal, sure, but there was something else in there too: _hope_.

I wasn’t fighting the thought alone anymore. I had my wife, my family, and most important of all, my system. This was going to be the Arcades vs. the Trauma, and we weren’t in the habit of losing.

## Zoe, 2021

The kids were all in the Dark Place.

It was cold, and there was water there, and they screamed for our help all the time. The adults didn’t hear it but I do, when we were almost asleep or when we got too drunk.

And I heard really, really bad memories from there too. The Bustle whispers them to me sometimes. Of Sunday School carpets, camera lenses, wood paneling and shag carpet.

I know Twi doesn’t want to die anymore and I’m happy about that. But if he wanted to die, that would be okay. I was tired of the screaming too. Dying meant I could go see grandma and that would be really nice…

## Addie, 2021

### “So you want to kill yourself: a safety plan for the Arcades”

1. Identify all alters who want to die, and all alters who want to live. Abstentions are allowed, but if you miss your chance to say your peace and we do it anyway, that’s on you.
2. If we are actively suicidal, pull out the phone tree and start trying to make contact with a friend.
3. If we are not actively suicidal, allow all parties inside to argue their cases.
4. A suicide vote must be unanimous.
5. Bring it up at the next therapy session, if you’re still alive .


## Twi, 2021

I was sitting on a bed in the real world, willing myself down into dissociation with the help of meditation. In headspace, I grabbed the PA microphone hanging behind the bar and spoke:

“I need help or we are going to die.”

It echoed inside the head. There was feedback. Fuzz on the line.

“If we do it this time, there are no brakes to stop the car.”

Honestly, I wasn’t trying to convince anyone in my head to go along with it. I was just blurting out my id, hoping to whoever watches over us multiples that the others would stop me. Because given the choice between “accept that my family harbored child predators” and a gun to the head, I was really liking the smell of gunpowder. I swear, at some point I bought a gun. That memory feels so real! Surely that had to be a real memory, and the gun was still in the condo somewhere, unlike all these men with sweaty hair and smiling faces—

I banged the bar, hard, and all the pins in the arcade tilted. “We will absolutely, positively die this time!”

Laughter echoed from the back of the arcade. Lucy shouted from the back: “We won’t. And don’t bang the bar! You know it sets the littles off.”

“We got so close last time, Lucy. I don’t know if I can chance it happening again. I won’t have the self control for it.”

“…fine. Give me a second and I’ll own you with logic.”

I laughed. “That’ll be the day.”

She emerged from the back of the arcade, huffing and puffing the entire way. “There,” she said, and I heard her dusting imaginary dust off her hands. “Right, Okay. So killing yourself.”

“Yes, you’re finally going to take me seriously!”

“Of course.” She winked. “So you want to die. Why?”

“I can’t live with this kind of evil in the world.” I spat the words with bile. “Where kids get hurt like this.”

“You’ve always known it happens.”

“It’s different when it’s me.”

“Fine.” She made a finger gun to point at my chest. “Bang! You’re dead. What happens next?” She even blew the smoke off the finger gun, bless.

“Well, I get relief.”

“And what then?”

“Not my problem.” I folded my arms under my chest and huffed. “I’ll be dead.”

Another poke at the chest. “And you’ll destroy D’s world. And you’ll break the hearts of a hundred plus people in Chicago, minimum. And you know who else you’ll kill?”

My ears perked at that. “I mean, I’d be dead.”

“Yep. Murder suicide.” She pointed the gun at her own head and dropped the thumb hammer before making a dramatic scene of dying on the hardwood floor. There were wails, wallows, even a little “I’m melting!” pantomime as she slowly, agonizingly slowly, knelt to play dead in my head. Then she laid still and silent. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth.

“Okay, I give up. Tell me the logic.”

“Not even gonna play along?”

“Nope!”

“Party pooper.” She got up, dusted off her clothes, and met my eyes again. “What happens then? You’ve shot yourself in the head, we’re dead. What’s next?”

My breath caught the words before I could say them. She saw the reaction, of course, and insisted I spit it out. “I… okay, I feel dumb now.”

“Say it.”

“I thought I’d start feeling better.”

“You’d be fucking dead, Twi. And in doing so you’d murder every man, woman, and child living in this head.”

“But—“

“Do you want Zoe to die, Twi?”

“Of course not!”

She waited.

“I mean, I made a mistake, Lucy. Forgot that we all shared a head.

“The kids need us.”

“They have you.”

“They need _us_,” she corrected me. “All of us. Working together and taking these memories seriously. Why do you think they were kept from us for so long?”

“I just thought, well.” My shoulders fell. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”

“That’s okay,” Lucy said. “It’s why we’re a team. So, just to wrap up this _lovely_ conversation, nobody in this head would dare think about killing the body, right?”

She glared at me, arms crossed and pupils blazing with intensity.

“Correct.”

“Because that would mean killing over 400 people inside this head right now without their consent.”  

“Yeah…” I did a double take. “Wait. 400?”

“You’ll meet them later,” Lucy said. “But they’re all in here, and killing them is a shitty thing to do.”

“We’re on the same page, Lucy.”

“Just confirming.” She gave me a quick hug. “The kids are still kicking up a fuss so I gotta go. But good talk.”

“Thanks.” She turned to run back into the headspace but stopped just shy of the door that led there.

“And Twi?”

I turned my gaze back inwards to see her waving up to me. “I really have to get back to the real world, Lucy!”

“Those fuckers don’t deserve to outlive us.”
  
I smiled at that. “Are we going back to that playbook? Living for spite? Worked out for us when we transitioned, at least.”

“Living for spite,” Lucy said. “Better than dying to spare your abusers their peace of mind.”

## Addie, 2021

I found the steps in the system chat one morning. The message was not signed, but I knew better than to delay and dally when death was on the line.

I had to tell the therapist, of course, and the next day we had an emergency session about suicidality. I knew I was in for it when both my psych and my therapist showed up on Zoom. They were both using the Calm, Concerned Voice you hear right before getting bad news. They asked how I was doing. (Re-experiencing CSA, thanks!) If I was safe. (I wasn’t.) If I had plans. (I did.)         

“Have you considered an outpatient therapy program?” Joey asked. “I think it’s in your best interest to give something like that some consideration. They’d give you skills to regulate and deal with the dissociation.”

“I’m fine,” I tried to say, but I couldn’t even bring myself to believe it. There were hundreds of kids in my head screaming and crying for attention, and the only thing I wanted was for them to stop.

Just… *stop*.

And then it dawned on me: this time, if I let things get too far out of hand, we would not survive the next attempt.                 

I felt more fear in that 10 second pause than I had ever felt in my life.

“What do we have to do to get better?” I asked, and my treatment team drew up a plan.


## Sam, 2021

“What we had to do” was go to the Nuthouse.

Okay, that’s self-effacing. The facility - Compass - was recommended by my therapist and the local queer community. Perfect spot for a dissociated system of hundreds of alters to get things straight. So I called and set an intake appointment, thinking there would be a waitlist instead of a triage process.

The interview was just _normal_ in a way I wasn’t expecting: in many ways, it was just another Zoom call. Lots of forms, insurance discussions, logistics, and rules review.

I panicked with 10 minutes to go before the remote intake session: was this the sort of thing you dress up for, like an interview? Or should I just look grungy as possible to play on staff sympathies? I decided on a plain t-shirt and a blurred background, in case the poor state of the office would come off as too obvious a tell that I was not okay.

Three therapists watched me intently on a zoom call as I answered questions like “are you currently a danger to yourself or others?” I told the truth in a haze of dissociation; of wanting to die, of the trauma, and of the system. They had me take some tests and had me wait while the results came in.

Then, a surprise: “We need to get you in as soon as possible.” I don’t know why, but part of me was expecting rejection out of this, if that makes sense? Like I was still making a big deal out of nothing, and if that were true then the trauma wasn’t that bad. (Nevermind what Zoe shared, and how even sparing the memory a thought was enough to get the dissociative seizures going again. Look, denial is a real freaking thing with this disorder.)

The words “Trauma Program” and “three months’ came up, and my eyes sort of lost their focus. Surely I wasn’t this messed up Then I was off to what would become my full-time day job for the next three months: outpatient therapy.

In any case, I felt like a leech taking a spot from someone who _really_ needed it. And three months? Surely I wasn’t that crazy. Nothing _that_ bad happened because there was no way I was right about the sexual abuse.

(Which yes, I know is a trauma response *now* but still.)                        

I hung up the call and told my wife what happened. Again, no surprise or shock.

I told my friends what was going on. Again, no shock. One friend even offered “you’ve been on the edge of this breakdown for years now” - you know, just making sure I know how crazy I was. 

In the end, the only person shocked that we were partially hospitalized was, well, *us*.

## Addie, 2021

First, outpatient hospitals aren't these desolate, dilapidated buildings with iron bars and bendable knives. Compass was the calmest, most boring office you've ever visited. Calm, grey paint on all the walls, classrooms for group therapy with whiteboard walls, offices for therapists decorated in their own way, and that's about it. Going in felt simultaneously like a dayjob and an extremely safe space.

I don't know what exactly I was expecting the first time I walked into Compass. Strict rules, maybe. No-stab pens, lack of shoelaces, something of the sort. Instead, folks dressed like it was another day at the office. The strictest rules we dealt with regarded privacy and what we could say in group sessions. I agreed to all the rules, signed my name, and was then shepherded to a moderate-sized classroom with a whiteboard wall and comfy chairs. I was told to wait there, so I took some time to settle in.

Another lady sat cross-legged on the ground, chai in hand, ready to start the week. She waved to me as I settled in. I must... gosh, I must have been shaking like a leaf at that point. Losing the plot every ten seconds, jumpy like a box spring, eyes not even bothering to focus on the world around me.

I tried to mask the fear with a little small talk. "So uh, what are you in for?"

(Yeah, I made a jail joke while psychiatrically hospitalized. And yes, it was worth it. -Potts)  

She laughed. "Memory issues. Name's Danica. First day?"

"That obvious." That got a chuckle out of me. We traded pleasantries for a spell while I regained my confidence.

"What is this like, anyway?"  

"Oh, it's like professional development. Therapist comes in and teaches the class, you take notes. There's meditation and a mood check-in. Are you in the all-day program?"

It took me a second to translate "Partially hospitalized" to an all-day program, I'm ashamed to admit. "Yeah. Long day ahead!"

She cracked a smile. "They teach you a lot of skills here. Stuff you can use in the moment. It's not that bad, really! Like a college class for your brain. I hope it goes well for you!"

"Likewise!" I said with confidence. Oh, how little we knew Compass was going to crack things wide open, back in that classroom. We were too busy thinking about what a good student we could be at the place to give any thought to how fucking hard talking about your core trauma all day would be.


## Lucy , 2021

For the next three months my life turned into some twisted version of "The Office." Each morning I'd come to Compass, chat with my "coworkers" at the water cooler, and settle into whatever classroom was assigned to me that day. I made work friends and knew the schedule of my individual therapy sessions as easily as one feels time passing.

Week one was effortless, bordering on fun. The mood program focused on folks with anxiety and depression, for the most part, and that was a crowd I was more than used to being a part of. I started bringing an iPad to class, both for notetaking and for playing games during the breaks. I started dreaming of finishing the program in weeks, not months.

Week two, though? When they put me into the trauma program? Fuck week two.

First off, new group therapy rules started showing up. Details about your trauma were strictly verboten in group, for example. And every day began with a trip to a "grounding closet" full of mints, tactile toys, and ice packs.

Second off? These folks were absolutely, positively, 100% My People. Sure, there were all sorts of folks in the program, but the number of nerds, scene folk, and queer people in this class was an order of magnitude above everything in week one. No longer was I listening to the stories of folks Not Like Me; instead, we were about to rub elbows with trauma just like ours, hard lives, and goddamned amnesia walls falling in my head.

Like for example, the first day we showed up to the trauma program was a Friday, and on those afternoons the trauma group played games. We played charades together and honestly, not a bad way to pass an afternoon when you're too crazy to live a normal life. I thought I was having a good time until it came time to wrap up the session.

"One last meditation," the therapist explained. My teachers' pet ass was *here* for it. I sat cross-legged and settled into my own breath. Hell, I felt like I was going to have a peaceful meditation.

Then the therapist hits us with this: "Reflect on the game you played. Were you present and having fun, or were you *presenting*  yourself as someone who was having fun?"

And honestly? Stupid as it sounds that one broke me. I wasn't present. I was *never* present. Projecting joy? Sure. I could do that all day. But just letting go and being silly in front of other people? Are you kidding me? Not in a million years.

Being present was unsafe because it wasn't controlled.

Addie and I cried for the first time in years that night. Or at least we thought it was years. Turns out the kids had been having episodes for years without us knowing. Gotta love that DID amnesia!


## Addie, 2021

I gave my dad one last chance to explain everything while I was getting into the program. It was a compromise with the insiders: I could only contact that man if we were in good, supportive therapy. Try as I might, I couldn’t let that first phone call from my sister go. 

Everyone else in the family let it go. The family reunited, sans me, and we were slipping back into our old ways. But me? I couldn’t let it go. I _had_ to know, now that I was strong enough to know.

I sent a text to him: "You need to explain what's going on. From what I've heard, you’ve been sexually assaulting people. You've also been trying to pick up your female employees at work, which is a big red flag for me. You need to explain yourself."

And then, for the first time in _ever_, it feels like, he said yes.

In the past, I was terrified of the man. Maybe it was the rough treatment early on. Maybe it was Potts' fear reaction that kept us from pushing this direct conversation. Maybe it was the terror of not knowing about my own past, and that talking to him would give me clarity I wasn't ready for.

But we'd been in therapy for a year at that point and felt like we were ready for whatever. Our drinking was under control and we hadn't thought about killing ourselves in at least two months (a new record at the time!), so we finally felt ready to take this step.

"We're not sure about this," Misty said. "Seems dangerous. Bail”

"Keep the kids inside," I said, hoping she'd get the message and dissociate me away from any emotions those internal alters might bring up. Last thing I needed was to let any errant emotions sneak into my voice while on this call. D stayed on call upstairs, on the off chance that the conversation destabilized us.

I took the call while pacing around my condo. The phone rang right on time; even seeing the name in my phone sent a shiver down my spine. I pushed the green button and buckled in for whatever was going to happen next.

"Hello?"  

"Hello," my father said. There was something different in his voice. Cold. Emotionless. _Honest,_ in a way I hadn't experienced from him before.

"Doing well?" he asked.

"Getting through it. Herniated a disk in my back though."

"How's your wife? Is she doing okay?"

“They are recovering from top surgery right now,” I said, emphasizing the “they.” "We've talked about this before: they aren't a she, Dad. and they're doing fine. I'd like to stay on topic if at all possible."  

He seemed taken aback by that. "Wait. How's work? I have to tell you stories about the warehouses I bought in Virgina. It's a wild one!"

"I told you multiple times that I'm on short-term disability right now. I'm in a partial hospitalization program for Dissociative Identity Disorder."

"Right," as if I had told him the sky was blue, or that it would rain tomorrow. That was all the empathy he could muster in response to forgetting that my life had fallen completely apart over the course of the past few months.

"You know you can always reach out for advice. I raised you, and now that you're older I don't care what you do with your life. I'll always be here though. Like if you divorced your wife, we'd be up there tomorrow with a truck to move your stuff back home."

"Thanks," I said through pursed lips. “Thankfully won’t be necessary; D and I are very happy together.”

“Right.”

I felt as if I were about to dive headfirst into painfully cold water. The only way out was through, though.

“I heard you were accused of harassing your female employees. Tell me more about that."

"Yeah, I did make some of the women in my workplace uncomfortable by asking if they wanted a good time, but no affairs actually came of it! I'm in therapy now so I can know what I did was wrong. Besides, the woman who tried to sue me didn't have a case since she took the promotion I offered after she reported.

"...you still there?"

My eyes were wide with shock and my jaw firmly on the floor. How in the fuck did he just come out and _say all that_? How could you get to the end of that spiel without drifting off into a dissociated shame-spiral that should come along with _I tried to have sex with my subordinate employees and all they got for it was a lousy promotion_, but there was nothing.

"Did I lose you?"

I took a moment to ground, breathe, and keep from laughing. "No, I'm still here. I'm just processing, I guess. It’s a lot.”

"She wanted it," he said by ways of an excuse.

"So you did do it," I said.  

"Yeah. But you know what? I don't like your tone. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around you. Everyone in your life knows you as a girl Austen but I only have memories of old you. And you snap at me when I get the pronouns wrong--"

More paced breathing. More pacing. More shock. _Don't take the bait._ My sole goal in all of this was to stay aloof and professional. Don't let him push buttons. Just get to the facts, and nothing more.  

"I heard about your grandkid,” I said. "You were accused of some fucked-up stuff, and then I got radio silence for two months. What the fuck happened?"

He chuckled - laughed, really. Like this was a common conversation about spilled milk. I'll never forget it; the first thing he did when I brought up alleged child molestation

"Oh, that? I was just giving her a backrub.”

I felt my skin crawl as children inside burbled to the surface. Another deep breath. _Just a few minutes longer, kiddos. I promise._

"We worked it out as a family. Her brothers and sisters still visit but she doesn't come around anymore. Works out for everyone."

I had no response. For the first time, I was seeing my dad for who he really was: a lecherous old man, obsessed with sex, who didn't seem to grasp that what he was doing was extremely fucked up.

"Well, I raised you and you're on your own now. if you want my wisdom, I'll give it, but I don't care what you do, honestly. And besides, I hear that you don't like me or talk to your mom anymore. Is that true?"

(I knew immediately where he got the idea. The only person he and I shared as a social contact was my sister, of whom I thought I was speaking to in confidence. Icy fury bubbled in my veins at the realization, but I pushed it down to stay focused on the conversation at hand.)  

"I'm not talking about what happened fifteen years ago, Dad. I'm here to get the facts."

"I still think you're living in sin, but I have the grace to allow you to be a part of my life anyway. That's family love, Austen. That never changes. That's the facts."

And there it was: \_never changes.\_ even after all my successes, and all the things I did to try and earn his love, I'm still the broken, angry fucking tranny that left his abusive home at 18 to be their own person. And I'll always be that sinful, whiny tranny to him, no matter what I say or do.  

…And by the same token, I would never get past the short-tempered, mean monster six-year old Potts had conjured of him.

But something was different this time: _I knew how to be monstrous too._

"You have no idea what it's been like for me," I snapped. "I can't remember what I did five minutes ago. I never know when some event is going to trigger a full on flashback. I have somatic seizures, dad. From past memories. Past memories I can’t remember, and that everyone insists are made up. But I didn’t make this shit up. Who would?

"Something terrible happened to me." I continued. "That's the thing: this disorder can only happen in extremely abusive homes. Hell, ninety-seven percent of people with DID also have a history of child sexual abuse, _and that includes me!_” I huffed and puffed. “But of course I’m back here, standing in front of you as a total mess, and here I am, asking for the person who did some of those things to notice that I'm hurt, and that my hurt is valid. _Of course it isn’t happening._”

"Oh," he said.

"But I'm going to remember," I told him. "That's the real goal for me. To figure out what happened to break me like this and to make sure it sees the light of day. I’ll get there because you taught me that I needed to be strong from a very young age, and I thank you for that.

“And for fuck's sake, why do you straight men have to give polyamorous folk like me a bad name? Define your relationship with your wife and stay within its goddamn boundaries."

"I didn't know."

"I know. I'm glad you're seeking help, dad. But I can't be a part of that help. I'll be around every once in a while. Like a comet I guess." I smiled through my rage and hoped that the result came out cheerful, but firm. Knowing my track record of autistic miscommunication, I was sure it wouldn’t.

"I really do hope you get better," I said in the silence, and I still mean it. We said our goodbyes, and that we loved each other.

And when it was over, I fell completely apart with all the pent-up rage and fear that had built up over the course of a ten minute conversation.


## Twi, 2024

Again, I don't want this memoir to be the judge of my blood family's current character. I'm sure in the past fifteen years they've grown a lot, changed a lot. Maybe they're better people now. But I am still carrying the damage from this past, and the only way to heal that wound is to tell my story from my perspective.

…Our perspective, I guess.


## Lilith, 2024

Okay hold up, Twi. You're giving them too much credit. Let's do a quick lightning round of the things that this family has done for which we have multiple witnesses who can corroborate the account:

There was the time we were “in trouble” at the age of 30 because we liked a facebook photo of your sister’s birth instead of calling, even though nobody bothered to tell us anything about the events leading up to it. (Other than the baby shower, of course.) Remember how we spent the next three weeks navigating a nervous breakdown because of that interaction?

Or the time our father got power of attorney over an older gentleman he had little relation to. Remember how he sold the place out from under him and the inheritance somehow dried up?

What about the time he moved our stepfamily to Indiana to live in a house he designed, only to kick them out when they started pushing back against his manipulation?

That we still can't hear the words "idiot," "dope," or any of his insulting words without freezing in fear?

Or the way they taught the blind girl how to wash dishes - with insults, denigration, and yelling - to the point that finding a spot on a glass is grounds for a total mental breakdown?

And do you remember how they doubted that all that actually happened?

Look, we don't want you to judge them _now_ for what happened in the past. But these systems thrive because nobody tells the truth; without the truth, patterns can't be identified, and the abusive people get a free pass to write their own narrative as they ride into the sunset. This is our attempt to change that.

I don't care what they're doing. In fact, I don't want to know. They're not welcome in our life and I'm better for it. But I hope that by writing this shitty childhood story I can help at least one person identify their own wounds and seek safety away from their abusive family.

If even one person can escape their own torturous family because this book gave them the courage, it'll be worth all the bad blood and evil I’ve experienced over the past 40 years.

## Potts, 2021

…you know, the last time I had no tasks other than self-care was in 2008, right after I was laid off from my position as an English teacher right out of college. I spent the time playing lots of games, discovering my transness, and losing my blood family, all at the same time. But without a job to stress about, all of these things seemed so easy.

I had forgotten how, well, *nice* it was to not fret about my job performance, or the latest widget that needed releasing, or anything of the sort. For the first time in forever I felt like I could breathe.

First, I slept. I slept a TON. I spent my afternoons writing up lists of things I’d have time to do while going through the program. Then, I started writing again. Mostly in journals, but I managed to write a terrible novella while in the program.
I had expected to catch up on so many things: my electronics projects, music, game backlogs, the like.

But I underestimated how much of a gut-punch this kind of work would be. After a month we started struggling to pick something to do; bringing up the question would get hundreds of answers, and we’d end up spending the rest of the day dissociating into internet videos.

And that’s before we herniated a disc in our back, sapping the last of our resolve. For weeks the only thing I could do was lay down. Walking was agony, sitting was impossible, and our sleep went out the window.

So yeah, imagine meeting 400 of your closest roommates while in the worst pain of your life. It wasn’t pretty. At least some of them were content to doodle in the margins of our notes while we tried to focus at the outpatient center, though…

## Twi, 2021

On the third week, I think, I put down the armor that had kept me safe for decades.

Hate to admit it, but one of my flaws is that I want to be above the fray. Chill and confident projection kept us safe as a child and loved as an adult. Why in the world would I give up on such a good thing?

But I got brave one time and shared some details from my past. “I can’t remember what I do from day to day,” I said to a circle of fellow trauma survivors. Me, I’m on the ground taking studious notes on my iPad and trying to be the best patient I can be, bless.

“Just, my life is a long string of flashbulb memories that make no sense together. I’ll wake up in a place I don’t remember travelling to. And honestly, it scares me.”

“Being a system?” the counselor offered.

I nodded.

“But it’s not your alters, is it? You talk about them with, like, joy and stuff.”

“I don’t follow.”  

“You’re not scared of your system. You’re scared of the trauma.”

And there it was, clear as crystal. I was afraid of being broken, of being vulnerable and open about the things that hurt us so much. Finally, we could relax and live without worrying about being in trouble!

## Addie, 2021

A month after the last call I got a call from dad.

This ended up being the last meaningful conversation I had with my dad, and it all started with a stupid birthday call. See, the only time I spoke to my dad since, gods, high school at least, we made a point to connect on birthdays and holidays. It was my second month at Compass, I think, and I had been in the odd position of receiving not one, but two calls from him while I was under care.

I just wish it had been something more than what it was. A fight, maybe. Something better than me firing off a letter I should never have sent or something like that. But as it stands? Yeah. Birthday.

This time was going to be different, though. I wasn’t going to sit on what was bothering me. Maybe, I reasoned, maybe the issue is that I’m not explicit enough about what’s bothering me. Maybe being direct and firm in my boundaries means I can invite him in.

Maybe, I thought, a conversation about what was actually going on was in order.

I took the call on my bed, surrounded with the littles’ favorite toys in case someone got triggered. D sat within listening distance in case things got too triggery. We got through the pleasantries as best we could.

“How’s work?” he asked.

“I told you, dad. I’m doing a mental health outpatient program. I haven’t worked in a month.” It’s true - we had a few calls while things fell apart. But I was shocked to hear him just forget something so important.

“Oh, right. Hope you feel better.” He said it with no emotion. “You talking about the past still?”

I knew what was next. For the first time in, well, _ever_, I got to look at the chat with fresh eyes. The shocking part was how easy the patterns were to spot, once you knew what to look for. *Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim and Offender,* the program called it.

“I don’t think you realize how much this affecting me,” I said. I could feel my spine stiffen and my eyes furrow with laser focus. With dad it is always, _always_ maximum effort. “I get seizures because of this. I don’t know what day it is, let alone what time it is. I am on the cusp of losing my job at work and this… this is _it_?”

I felt like I could watch a bouncing ball under my dad’s voice, predicting what would happen next. *That didn’t happen. And if it did, it wasn’t that bad. And if it was, that’s not a big deal. And if it is, that’s not my fault. And if it was, I didn’t mean it. And if I did, you deserved it.*

“Well, I did what I could, and you can take my advice if you want it. If you don’t, no sweat off my back. But I’m still family to you. If tomorrow you and D got divorced, we’d be there with a truck the next day to move you back home. That never changes.”

I tilted my head at that. My marriage? There were an endless number of ways to express that familial love; why land on one that requires me to divorce my wife? I tried to laugh to fill the empty space on the phone: “Gosh, dad. D and I are incredibly happy together. I’m not sure why you’d say that.”

But he went on regardless: “You know, it bothers me that you snap at me about your gender. Everyone you know now knows you as a girl, but I have memories of my son, and you bite my hand whenever I get things wrong—“

This conversation is going nowhere. It hasn’t gone anywhere in years. Not for 15 years since my transition have we had a single constructive conversation about it, but to be polite I smile and actively listen in hopes he’ll stop trying to hammer me over the head with a fifteen year old life change—“

## Lilith, 2021

“Please. stop. Addie, Twi, Lucy, all of you.”

We were back in the arcade again, guys. Sorry to yank you out of the story.

Twi straightened out his suspenders and slicked back a lock of green hair. “What are you talking about? We were going over how much Compass helped us. I thought you’d like to us talking about that!”

“No, Twi. You weren’t being truthful.”

Addie gathered her things. She always had “things” inside: a set of pens, a laptop, deck of cards. Always in need of a distraction, an action to do to avoid being alone with her thoughts. “Look, this seems like a you-and-Twi conversation so I’m going to see myself out, if that’s okay.”

“It’s not, Addie.”

She sneered. “Let us back in.”

“No. Not until you admit why we’re here.”

Silence. Twi looked down at his shoes. Addie tilted her head in thought. They both searched for a lifeline, some conversation starter that would get me to back off. Some of the others walked into the bar with us, thinking they could help, but I shot them a harsh stare until they went back inside. Because I wasn’t backing down. Not this time.

“This book isn’t about Dad.”

Twi mumbled, “Tell that to the last three quarters of the book.”

“I… I just.” I pinched the bridge of my nose. “The two of you don’t want to say the words, do you? Gods, you adults are _insufferable_ sometimes. You’re really going to make me be the one to write it, aren’t you?”

They couldn’t meet my eye. 

“We were trafficked, friends. Traf-ficked. Two syllables. Not hard to say.

“And it wasn’t dad.”

Silence filled our brain. After years of constant, low-level voices, it felt weird to hear dead silence.

“Yeah.” Twi said as he kicked the floor. “That thing.”

“It’s high time we talk through it. Talk about what happened to Zoe. What happened to the Bustle.”

Twi stamped his foot on the ground. Glasses on nearby tables shook. “No! The memoir will work without it. We mixed up the details at the start and it can be about whoever we want—”

“That’s not the point, Twi. We didn’t write this book for the world. We wrote it for ourselves. Because if we don’t take the time to write out what happened to us it will never feel real, or whole, or complete.

“Becuase it’s not, folks. It’s a whole goddamn mess, and we’re stuck cleaning it up. But we can make lemonade out of this if we want to. We can show the world what trafficking actually looks like.”

“It’s too intimate.”

“And besides, if we decide differently later we don’t have to keep it in the revision.”

Twi threw up his hands. “Fine. Whatever. I just don’t look forward to it.”

Addie’s raised an eyebrow and resumed her carnival-barking,  desperate, whining deflection. “Yeah, we have to do this, but I figured we could do some more fun stories first, right? Like that time Twi spent, like, five hundred bucks on electronic instruments he didn’t need?”

“Hey!”

“No, Addie. We’re going to face this. Together. For the kids we left behind to face the horrors over and over again. It’s high time we dig the kids out of that dank, horrendous pit.”

“Let’s visit the Dark Place,” I said.
