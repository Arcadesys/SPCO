## Twi, 2002

Picture the timeline of your life. (Go ahead. I'm inviting you to enter the narrative.) Now, imagine a specific year in your youth. I bet you, given a little prompting, you could recall one memory, embarrassing or otherwise, for every year of school you experienced.

Now imagine a long, blurry blind spot smearing any context of your memories, and you start to approach how our memory is organized. I have no idea when we are, only that I was laying on my bedroom floor and praying for a miracle.

I'm a guy still, outwardly. In top shape, so this had to be, uh, high school at some point? Laying in front of me are computer parts my dad picked up on the cheap when I asked for a computer. "If you can build one out of this, it's yours," he said, and I spent a year making that happen. With all my fingers crossed I turned on the rickety, old Celeron 200 tower and hoped that the backup to my hard drive would actually power on--

A post beep. Success! I jumped from the floor and pumped my fist. Next, the install CD. Here's hoping the drive works--

My bedroom door was thrown open without a knock. It was Whit on the other side, shouting to surprise me.

“Hey!”

I jumped; she laughed. I jumped at everything: horror movies, friends tapping my shoulder from behind, even the slightest hint of anger tinging someone's voice. No matter what the surprise, I was terrified of it. Though I was working on fixing that.

That was one of my skills I told no one about. If I worked hard enough, and stayed focused, I could make emotional pain not hurt anymore. No more jumping at shadows if you don't care what happens next. No more crying in front of everyone's ridicule and scorn if you simply refuse to listen to your emotional center.

"I'm almost finished here," I said. This was a lie. But sometimes, if I told a good enough lie, they’d go away.

They waited for me to meet their eye. This was a thing people insisted on with me and honestly, not a fan. I can't see their face anyway because blindness, and they know that.

"Family time."  

"Five minutes."

"I'm just delivering the message." The door slammed shut once more. I turned off the computer and hoped it would boot later. As I went to get up there was a wave of vertigo, a sudden exhaustion, as if I hadn't breathed in an hour and needed a gasp of air, right then, right now--

## Potts, 1999

This is how autistic I am, as told by a joke at a half-full cosmic bowling night at an alley in Lynchburg, VA. We're focused on the DJ booth in the center of all the lanes, where a joke contest is underway. Picture a young Twi standing at the mic, all shakes, as he starts telling the best anti-joke he knows: "So there's this duck."

I am 13 fucking years old.

We're in... Virginia, I think. I have trouble remembering what events happened when and where. My entire family just tried to stop me from doing this, but there I was, all smiles and laughs, ready to tell this anti-joke I love.

"He stops by a lemonade stand and asks if there's any duck food."

You know how this one ends, and if you don't - oh, you sweet innocent soul, please google the punchline - but suffice it to say that the joke landed flat as a fart.

## Twi, 1999

I started hitting myself the night I told that joke.

I couldn't escape the story. Any mention of glue, ducks, or the slightest excuse to put me down came back to the duck food joke. I wanted to cry so badly but I knew I couldn't if I wanted to de-escalate the situation. So some impulse inside just, kinda, took over. My hand reared back and landed a huge slap right across my left cheek.

It was a rush.

The rest of the night out was spent feeling equal parts sick, dizzy, and out of it; while feeling like we had a solution to the problem for the first time in a long while. I'd take an insult from a family member, drift off into a daze, and then slap myself to return to reality. It was... well, kind of fun, honestly? Bouncing between the world being dream-like and the world snapping to focus?

"Stop that," someone said. I started doing it quietly.  

I lied. "It's late. I'm just keeping myself awake."

And they believed me.

## Potts, 1997

The secret recipe to a queer life as a child in a rural town in the 90s reads as follows:

* Dignity, 0g
* Personalities, a handful
* Memory, one brain, split in such a way that information can't leak between parts
* Two big stones for lying blatantly to everyone around you

Set dignity aside.

While at home, mix personalities well, strain through cheesecloth, reveal as little as possible.

Out and about, assign one personality to every friend group in life.

Upon returning home, stonewall and lie about your day to avoid giving as much information as possible.

Serve generously over some semblance of a life you cobble together through the lies, and hope to fucking god nobody figures out your computer password.

## Twi, 2000

Family time included Maury Povich, spaghetti with jarred alfredo, and steamed broccoli. I don't remember much - I don't even remember if this was the duck food joke year - but I stayed upstairs until someone else left to do their homework. (Leaving first was not an option in those days.) But I was free after just an hour of talk shows and dang near skipped my way to my bedroom.

I thought about locking my bedroom door but decided against it. For one, it didn't stop someone from trying the knob and then screaming about the door being locked. And for two, the jump scare was unavoidable. People didn’t knock in this house.

The very first thing I did, post boot, was to install mIRC and pop onto The Blind Pig. Knowing I could reach them without my family knowing about it was the whole purpose of this stupid computer project, and the whole reason I ended up going into tech as an adult.

All of this work to gain a single drop of privacy, and it was worth every minute.

## Addie, 2000

So back when I was a kid, internet "stranger danger" was still a thing. Freed of the prying eyes of my parents, though, I started exploring.

My dad made me a computer desk out of the cannibalized bits of my childhood bed. Seeing and feeling the grain made me feel weird in a way I couldn’t explain, but it was nice of my dad to put it together. He may not be around a lot thanks to work but when he is home, he does try.

I’m terrified of my stepmom. Potts doesn’t know it but she makes things up to get me in trouble sometimes. That, or I forget what I did and what I didn’t do. That happens a lot to us.

The desk faced the door now, so that if anyone stormed in I could defuse the situation with a calm look and an outstretched "please wait while I take off my headphones" finger.

"You forgot to take the dog out," it came off with bile, almost a sneer.

I took a breath. This was my thing now; respond to anger with zenlike calm. "I'm very sorry for not taking the dog out earlier. If you could provide me with a list of chores you'd like me to do, that would help me be more organized!"

"You should just know."

"Well, I don't. Can you help me with that, please? Or let me know if I'm being punished for forgetting?”

"Family time upstairs."  

"I have to write for school," I said. This was a lie, as the plan for the night was to write in my novel and chat with folks online at The Blind Pig. But the person at the door didn't need to know that.

Their lip curled into a sneer. "You're always writing."

"I want to be a writer," I said, shrugging.

The door slammed again.

## Potts, 1994

"He keeps hitting me!"  

"Finish the fight," my dad said. And I knew I could; with my wrestling skills most people didn't bother to throw hands with me. I just… well, I didn’t like to fight. It felt bad hurting other people.

But this family member was punching me in the face, not landing any real blows. Anger without a lot of training, you know? So I called for my dad to break it up without me having to get physical.

But no. “Finish the fight.” So I did, and I’m proud to say that to this day, I have never thrown a single punch at anyone. Armlocks are just that much cleaner.

## Twi, 1999

When I was younger, I remember this one extremely specific sensation that felt better than almost literally anything else. I called it "popping my brain" because it felt just as relieving as popping my ears, or my joints.

It started with this dizziness and intense pressure that built up behind my eyes. Then, explosive relief; the mind drained its contents out of my ears. I felt myself floating up, foot over head. Then the world clicked back into focus and I'd feel calm and refreshed.

It would happen when I was out with family, going between classes at school, on the wrestling mat, anywhere. It's appearance was unpredictable and frequent, even I had trouble remembering what it felt like.

(Always struck me as strange that I couldn't remember it. Something that rivaled orgasm for "most pleasurable thing you can do" should have been a huge signpost in our memory, but every time me tried to remember it would slip out of my fingers.)

I couldn't force it to happen. I couldn't predict when, and I clung desperately to any memory of the experience in hopes of finding a pattern. But the result was always the same: a vague recollection of the "pop," relief, and a strong urge to let it go.
I told everyone about it, thinking it was a normal, everyday experience. If I could "pop" my brain, after all, it makes sense to assume others can do it! But everyone looked at me like an alien.

"You're sure this doesn't make sense to you?" I'd ask. "No," was always the reply. And then they'd chuckle and move on with their day, surely thinking that I was a weirdo.

I tried for years to learn how to "pop" my brain. The only success I had was when I was alone. There I had success with a few things that didn't make much sense: watching shows I loved when I was five, playing an old video game, watching Star Trek (and only Star Trek!).

The closest I got to "popping" my brain on command was if I focused on pulling myself away from the world. I'd sit on the floor and stare at the wall. Then if I imagined myself falling deep into myself I could experience the "pop" in real time.

But I could only do it a few times a night at most, and even then it only happened when I knew nobody could possibly come down to the basement to interrupt me.

I had forgotten about "brain popping" for years, if I'm being honest. It was impossible to do on purpose when I was in college, while I was transitioning, and about a decade of living with roommates. The sensation, hazy and fleeting as it was, became a thing of the past.

This is a long way to say this:

If I had access to someone who could have told me that brain ""pop"" was a switch, and that the reason I couldn't remember it was that we had amnesia and DID, our recovery would have gone so much smoother!"

## Addie, 2003

Right. Where was I?

It's 2003. I'm in a new house. Same family, but when we moved in I negotiated hard for the mother-in-law suite that sat at the front of the house. There were strict terms from my end:

* Half of my room was storage and an office for Dad.
* Visitors MUST knock if the door is closed.
* In return, I will fix any and all technology in the house until I leave for college.

Right. College. I got a pretty decent scholarship to a school a few hours away. Problem was, it was an all-male college and, girl that I was, I'd have to hide the entire time I was there.

But my North Star mantra continued to rattle in my head. *Survive. Escape.* I have no clue where it came from but the words rattle around my head most days now. In a few months, I'd be out of this place, and they'd never be able to hurt me again.

In a few months, I'd be free. Well, free-ish. Not like I'd get to be like Kristi from The Blind Pig anytime soon. I learned she was trans a few weeks earlier and had been obsessing over the information for what felt like weeks now.

The computer dinged. Private message from The Blind Pig! My heart fluttered as I opened the chat window to see Rabbit's username on my screen.

Rabbit was my writing mentor in high school and college. He's this no-nonsense union guy from Tennessee who wrote something so beautiful that it made me want to be a writer. He also presents online as a small, white rabbit, which I vibe with. He's also taken a shining to me the past couple of years, and in the future he'll help me afford some creature comforts in college. At the time I think it's about my writing talent, he says, but in retrospect I know what's happening.

This is the village raising the child, if the village was spread out across cyberspace.

"How many more days?" the message read.

"Ninety days. Just got my laptop for college too. I'm transferring my manuscripts over now."

"Still writing?"

"Always writing :)"

And it was true. Adding an hour and a half of writing per day took away a lot of opportunities to get wrapped up in family drama. You might even say my entire writing hobby is based on a maladaptive coping mechanism! But at the time, I was 18 and putting out 30,000 words a month, give or take. Mostly in the shared universe of The Blind Pig, where all the chat members had shared history.

"Are they treating you well?"

"Well enough. Mom fell off the wagon again, I think. Been avoiding her house for a while."

"That'll happen."

A long pause.

"You're going to soar, Sly. I know it."

The words made me feel strange. First, Sly's my name on the server, and for those curious, I'm currently pretending to be a squirrel. Second, there was this alien warmth bubbling up in my stomach. For a moment I let myself relax. I'm safe. People knock now. And I've been so distant from the family that they finally left me alone.

That's all I ever wanted out of them: space. Growing up in a small town is like being a goldfish in a bowl, and every small slip-up I make in town (say, expressing my true feelings), I'd end up dragged across the coals by them. So I stopped sharing my feelings with my friends, picked up a bunch of hobbies that required my computer, and slowly disentangled myself from the family unit.

Looking back, it's sad that having no relationship was better than any relationship at all, but there it is. The people at The Blind Pig - the folks who pretend to be raccoons and rabbits and deer and cats and more - they know everything that's happened in my life for the past four years. I poured out my heart in stories, and told the people in the chat why my heart was so heavy. It's the first place someone said the word "abuse" to me. The first time I felt cared for, seen, and absolved of all my weird habits that got me in so much trouble at home.

The channel was my confessional, and I always left feeling better for it.

"I'm so happy to be on the outs, Rabbit."

"I know. I met your dad. You know my feelings on him." Read: they met at a play I was in, and based on what Rabbit said afterwards it took everything in him to not punch my father square in the jaw.

Some rabbits have claws, yaknow.

We chatted about the novel I was writing at the time. (It was a miserable thing, in the end, and not worth going into here. -Twi) Then, small talk about his family, brainstorming ideas for the next story, and before I knew it it was Rabbit's bedtime.

"Keep counting the days, Sly. Are your parents still chipping in?"  

"Yeah. We're splitting the cost in thirds."

"Good. Let me know if there's anything i can do."

I shut the chat window and went back to setting up my store model Dell Inspiron for the next four years, digging through my files, reminiscing about the stories behind me, and hoping that one day I'd write enough garbage to build a mountain to that promised land of "published author."

## Twi, 2003

It's a late night in 2003 and class signups are in progress. But I'm not at the registrar's office; instead, I'm in a nondescript stairwell forcing a panic attack through the phone. On the other end is my mom; we were still talking every day while I was in college, mostly about nothing. I did get a cheer out of her this year when I mentioned I got drunk for the first time, too, which was nice, but this was different. I needed help, advice, _something_.

Twenty-five hundred dollars stood between me and continuing my college career. My credit is worse than nonexistent due to a bank error that put my father's mortgage on my credit report. I have no idea what to do next.

"He's not going to pay.”

“Of course he won’t, the snake in the grass!” We’re talking about dad here. When I left for college we - my dad, my mom, and Addie - agreed to a payment plan. Each of us would be responsible for a third of the tuition costs that remained after my scholarship. I had already handled my part in the form of a loan. The money is due in 10 days, and my dad just informed me that he wouldn’t pay, that he never promised to pay, and that solving this was my responsibility.

“I don’t know what to do.”

She groaned. “I’d help, but you know I’m disabled and then the divorce happened, so I can’t.”

“No, I get it, mom.” I forced myself to take deep breaths. “It’s okay. I’ll… I’ll figure something out.”

“Can’t believe he screwed things up this much, though.”

“I know. it’s bullshit all around.”

“Love you.”

“Love you too.” I hung up and nearly threw my flip phone into the wall. Instead, I did the only thing I knew made things better when I was feeling this way.

I called Rabbit.

He answered in two rings. “You okay, Sly? You’re breathing really heavy.”

He listened to the whole spiel without saying a single word as I yelled and grumbled and rushed my words with the terror of losing my only lifeline out of my hometown. His first words? “You are going to get through this.”

The voice echoed in my head again. _Survive. Escape, at all costs._

_I believe Rabbit._

“Okay, okay.” I took a breath and surprisingly, the panic eased off. “So I have 10 days to figure this out. What do I do?”

“Can you get a loan?”

“No. My dad’s mortgage ended up on my credit report by mistake so my credit is trash.”

He hissed through his teeth and held his tongue. “Have you talked to the bursar’s office about this yet? There’s a whole crew of people in colleges to help folks like you.”

“I didn’t think about that.”

“You’re not the first kid to get screwed like this,” he said. “You won’t be the last. But it’s late, and all those offices open tomorrow morning, I’m guessing?”

“Yeah.”

“You don’t sound okay.”

“I’m not, Rabbit. I need 2500 dollars and don’t have the credit to get it.”

“Okay. Actually, I’d like to do something for you tonight. Would you be comfortable sending me your bank information?”


## Potts, 2003

The magnificent bastard sent me fifty bucks a month, every month, for the duration of my time in college. There was only one string attached; I had to spend the money on nice things, never necessities. It was there to make my life a little better, and I got the first payment that very night. I spent it on booze like a proper college kid, of course, but the thought was nice.

And you know what? I’m not ashamed to say I cried the first night he sent that. Felt good to know someone had my back no matter what.

## Addie, 2002

Treating my family like roommates felt cozy, good. I think we were all on the same page for the first time in what felt like years; I was leaving in a few months, and asserting my independence just so happened to include fewer family dinners, chore responsibilities, and desire to pay attention to everyone's day to day.

Besides, I'd long since learned to treat them like strangers. It's safer that way, when you refuse to let people judge you. Hard to get a rise out of someone whose emotional bonds have been sanded clean away out of a deep need for safety. And for the most part, they kept their distance without asking why I was so cold toward them.

I was about to drop into the Pig when there came a knock at the door. “Come in!” I said, and my stepmom opened the door. She wasn’t yelling about anything, which was always a bad sign. I tried to defuse the moment: “Did I forget to do a tech thing? Sorry, I’ve been busy getting ready for college. I can get right on whatever you need—“

"I found this note." She held up a piece of printer paper that had been folded into eighths. I had dozens of these as part of my “memory system” - since I couldn’t remember anything during the day I kept a pen and paper in my pocket to track todos, ideas, and promises I’d made. Then at night I’d upload the whole mess into a word document that tracked every little memory in my life.

I knew immediately which paper she was talking about. Somewhere along the way I’d started drafting up a suicide note on one of those pages. (Look, when you want to kill yourself this badly you always want to have a back-pocket note in case you decide to go through with it!) But the important thing is that to have found this paper she would have had to shuffle through dozens of papers on my bed.

"Why do you want to kill yourself? You have your family. What would the town think if you did this?”

I don't know why but when she said it I knew, right there and then, that this wasn't about me. This was about what the town would think if I had mental health issues.

I am 18 fucking years old, four months away from never having to listen to these people ever again, and they’re still rooting through my stuff. But today, we were going to talk about suicide, and I wasn’t going to hold back.

Who knows? maybe they’d surprise me with decency in the face of mental illness.

I swung the office chair around to face her. “I’m fine," I said. "I've been wanting this since I was 7. It’s normal for me.”

I have no clue why I said that.

“Why?”

The world started going fuzzy. This happened to me sometimes. I’d freeze up, unable to say a word, until someone threatened me to talk before they hit me. I shrugged, honestly not knowing how to answer the question.

I’m 18 years old and in desperate need of a therapist. However, I don’t trust these people enough to let them know that.

_Survive. Escape._

“I just want to help.”

“I know.” I said. “I don’t know if I _can_ be helped.”
 

## Twi, 1999

Back in the alley I’m listening to people laughing at me and trying not to cry. Crying only makes the abuse worse.

Potts tagged out whenever the verbal abuse started. No, that was my station, looking back. Learning how to snivel and cower from the spotlight whenever there was a chance of getting keelhauled for something that set our parents off.

They're all laughing at me again and I'm trying my best to isolate. If I don't give them anything emotionally charged, they eventually get bored and move on. You just gotta keep swallowing your dignity.

I'm 13 fucking years old and I want to die. The family would be better off if I weren't around. Maybe I deserved it.

A voice from within spoke. Its words, a warm hug in the too-cold bowling alley. "You never deserved it."

"Them making fun of my duck food joke?"

The voice giggled. "That one, no. You did walk into it eyes open, you know."

"I didn't."

The voice considered this. "Okay. Fair."

I felt the world spinning again and planted another slap on my face. Nobody seemed to notice I was doing this, or if they do they're too afraid to intervene. The voice goes away for a brief moment, and I use the time to scan around with my ears, listen for any conversations that might turn into me getting into trouble--  

"I'm here to help you."

"I'm making you up," I responded. Another slap, but this time the vertigo got worse. I sat in a corner of the alley, dissociated out of my gourd, actively conversing with a voice in my head.

"I'm real and I can prove it."

"I guess you're going to tell me anyway." I catch someone giving me an odd look and realize I've been talking out loud this entire time. Again, *I am 13 fucking years old.*

The voice continued: “Do you remember how you got here?"

"Sure! I just--uh." The words caught in my throat. "Well, I'm in a bowling alley, and my extended family is here so--"

"You don't know. You're guessing."

I shook cobwebs from my head. “What’s the difference?”

"Yeah. kinda weird you can't remember, right? Well, you're in Virginia. The year is 1997. You're out bowling with your extended stepfamily right now, and you just told a weird joke about, uh, ducks and glue?"

"We went over that already."

"Right. But you can never be too careful when trying to remember what's happening around you!" She giggled. "Now come here, let me help you a bit. You're tight as a guitar string!"

I swear to anything holy this is true: *I could feel her hugging me. *A full on sensory fantasia followed as the floodgates broke between us. First, warmth and comfort. Then, resolve. Finally, she closed her eyes and suddenly I was surrounded with warmth, green glow, the smell of clove and the texture of fine fabric under the fingers.

She held me like that for a long while, until I caught eyes with a family member who thought my smile was me making fun of them. I never quite know how to make my face do the things other people do, and so when normal people see me they think I'm making fun of them, or I'm ignoring them, or I'm not paying enough attention.

"Tally, I feel like I'm stuck in my own brain."

"You are. We all are. But for you? especially so. And until you escape, you're gonna be trapped here, stuck inside your own mind and fuzzing out like, well, like a stoner who had too much Maui Wowie."

I laughed. "Okay, so I'm crazy."  

"Yes, but don't worry. You'll forget about this in a few minutes."

"What?"

I could feel her - *feel her! - *pulling away from the embrace so that she could slap her knee. "Gets me every time! Oh, my gosh. Sorry! I know this is hard but you know, I don't get to say hi often."  

"I don't want you to leave."

She looked around. "It's not safe here for me, Twi. That’s your job.”

I wanted to ask how she knew my name but she shushed me with an outstretched finger, as if a fairy godmother had just scolded Cindarella for how excited she got about the pumpkin chariot.

## Addie, 2001

It’s… gosh, I can’t remember anymore. Time is just so fuzzy when you’re a system. But I’m in the living room of my father’s house - a pole barn that we did a DIY conversion on - and I’m in trouble. Feels like every time I think of that living room, with its vaulted ceilings and short pile blue carpet, I think about the homemade cherry wood chair my dad would pull out when it was time to yell at me.

It wasn’t enough to communicate that I had done wrong. No, there needed to be ritual to the cycle. No TV, no music, nothing but the ticking of the clock above, the hum of an aquarium filter on my side, and my father and stepmother sitting on the couch across from the chair, like prosecutors lording over a witness stand.

I can’t remember exactly what I’m in trouble for this time. Maybe it’s the fact that I reported my wrestling friends for proselytizing me for hours on end at a wrestling camp, including trying to keep me up late so that I could accept Christ as my savior. I brought it up to them hoping that they’d take my side, that they’d see that the experience was bad for me, and want to help me avoid that in the future.

But in reality, they also wanted me to accept Christ as my savior. In fact, the fact that I hadn’t came as a total surprise to them, even though I didn’t spend much time in church growing up.

“Have you done the research?”

“Dad, I was kept up all night by friends who were trying to make me do something I didn’t want to do. I feel betrayed.”

I didn’t say that, of course. Could you imagine, having the stones to call your old man out as a teen? Gosh, he would have had my head on a platter! No, I looked to the ground as the world around me went fuzzy.

I just didn’t want to be there.

“We raised you better than this. You gonna speak up for yourself or you just gonna sit there slack-jawed?”

I hummed. Humming was my dissociation response back then; when I couldn’t form words, or the world became too fuzzy for me to function, I’d start losing the ability to speak. “Umm,” I started.

“Umm.” My stepmother this time. “Um. Uh. Uhhhh. That’s _all you say_. We’re not going to hurt you.”

I don’t believe them.

Another voice echoed in my head. “Want out?”

“Excuse me?”

My stepmom saw me looking around. “Lookit you, figuring out what lie you’re going to tell next. Go ahead, think of a good one!”

“Relax. Picture trying to sink down into yourself and I’ll take care of the rest.”

“You’re such a liar, Austen.”

“On three,” the voice said, and on the count of one I was gone.

## Twi, 1999

On the car ride home from the alley I pretended to be asleep while talking to Tally.

"Why will I forget?"

"We all have our part to play in this system," Tally said. "I'm keeping good things pure for everyone. You're, well." Her eyes lowered. "I'm sorry, Twi."

"But I'm making you up. You're not real."

"And yet, you don't know what I'm going to say next."

Someone in the front of the van made another duck food joke, making sure I was awake to hear it. I rolled my eyes and went back to talking to Tally.

"Tell me more."

"I can't," Tally said. "Not yet. But listen: your only job is to survive, Twi. Survive, and escape. I'll explain everything later, I promise. But for now, I'm fading."

"Fading?"

"You're going to forget me soon," she clarified. "Remember: survive, escape. That's all that matters."

I don't know why I believed her. Maybe it was the fact I couldn't control the voice. Maybe it's the warmth she made me feel. Hell, maybe it was the implied threat that she could take over whenever she wanted, do what she wanted, and I would be powerless to stop her. But in that moment, I *knew* Tally was real and I knew that she would have my back if I just did my part.

"What now?" I asked, but Tally was gone once more.


## Tally, 2001

I came to with a deep breath and a shake of the head. It was… well, pre-2002 I know. We were in the barn with the blue living room and honestly, fuck that place. I was tired of the yelling. It didn’t help anyone, especially if I wasn’t going to get the support I needed. So instead, I went over the top rope.

“How can I stop this conversation?”

My stepmom raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”

“I think we’re at an impasse,” I said. “You want me to believe in God, but you can’t force me to believe any one thing. Would it help for me to lie and spare you the worry of the town thinking you raised an atheist?”

“No, we want you to be saved.”

I ignored that line. “Besides, I’ll be on my own in a few years. ‘Bout time I start making my own decisions.”

There was silence on the air. I could feel Addie inside buzzing with excitement; after years of trying we finally found a way to communicate our needs clearly. Even if they wouldn’t listen, we could still strike a deal.

“Would it help if I did my research?”

“Here’s my proposal: I put together a binder of research for theistic and atheist positions. I’ll highlight parts and make annotations to prove I did my reading. If I presented that to you in a month’s time, would that sufficiently resolve this conflict?”

I could watch the gears catch in their head as I spoke. I felt a rush of power, control. For the first time in my life _we were pushing back_.

“Once this work is completed, I consider our conversations about religion to be over. I want to never talk about this subject again with you.”

They considered it for a long minute before responding.

“That seems fair,” my Dad said.

“Then I’m going to get to that, if that’s okay by both of you.”

I picked up the chair and returned it to the dining room table while they watched me walk away, slack-jawed.


## Addie, 2001

I put together a three ring binder for those two with 200 pages of research, easy. All of it was annotated, highlighted, I’s dotted and T’s crossed. I treated it like my Ark of the Covenant, the first time I got one over on my parents instead of getting more abuse.

They didn’t even bother to help, of course. Not even to make their own argument for why I should be religious. I was left to do a college-level research paper on my own, and I’m almost certain they never cracked the binder to check my math.

Why not? Because the next week, while my dad and stepmom were upstairs watching more TV, I brought the binder to them.

“What’s this?”

“My research on religion.” I placed the binder on the table. “The first half contains theistic arguments, the second half has atheistic and comparative religion analysis. Would you like a walkthrough of the key points, or should I just leave this for you to peruse later?”

I think I’m 16 fucking years old and I just wrote my first annotated bibliography voluntarily.

“We’ll look at it later.

“Per our agreement, this concludes our conversation about religion.”

“Agreed.”

“I’m an atheist,” I said in a flat, declarative voice. “We will never speak of this again.”

“Agreed.”

I couldn’t show them everything then, but I tried to help where I could. I’m so sorry, Arcades. I wish I could have done more when we had the chance, but you weren’t ready. I promise you, this would have destroyed you years ago had you known.

## Sam, 2024

Right, uh, memoir stuff. Hi! The others asked me to contribute to this project so I wrote a this. I'm Samantha. And Misty. And a whole host of other girls who are sexual assault survivors that banded together. You may have seen them contributing to the memoir project in other parts of the narrative. A lot of us came together in the last system shake-up to form a single alter.

That's what we call 'em, at least. Shakeups. We'll hit some life milestone, or process some deep trauma, and our internal world gets thrown into a tizzy. What comes out the other end is... still me, technically. Still "us," still a collection of alters. But our skills, our demeanor, our everything else? You might as well roll a fresh set of alters and toss out what you thought you knew.

You have to understand that there's around 400 distinct parts inside this brain at all times, swimming around in an amnesia soup because of things that were done to us as children. When we grow, parts of our selves move to other parts of ourselves, taking with them their memories and their skills. The resulting alters are pastiches and we have to figure out who can do what all over again.

I can't tell you how exhausting it is.  To not know what day it is, what time it is, what I was just doing two seconds ago. To find half-done tasks someone inside started but didn't finish. To excusing yourself from a party you're enjoying because some kid inside wants to hump the air and scream into a pillow. To being treated like a _literal fucking child_ because you are temporarily not able to make decisions for yourself.

So why wouldn't we try to pretend that things are better? Why would we want to be connected to who we really are inside, when that person is just a pile of miserable little alters?

For now, I'm a bit more connected to the inside than I was before, and that's a good feeling. The more we come together, the fewer gaps in time we feel. The more we push our healing, the less our system symptoms get in the way.

But still, deep down in our heart of hearts, we know that our brain's totally broken beyond the point of repair. And it scares the fucking crap out of us to think about it.

...oh wow I type so differently now lol

I really thought hypergirly Melody name was going to stick didn't I lol
