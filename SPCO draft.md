# Twi | Chicago, 2019
Chicago, 2019. Cold moonlight drenched the stairwell beside Lake Michigan, my hand clenched around a paring knife. Nearby, a balcony party echoed with Polish pop music—a surreal soundtrack to my quiet panic.

Lake water whispered against my building, its rhythm forcing shallow breaths. Above, orange floodlights drowned the scene in stark contrasts. My mind swirled in a drunken haze, a sense of dread crystallizing around two facts:

One: I was severely drunk, though memory failed me on exactly how I'd arrived here—outside my condo, alone, crying by the lake.

Two: I knew why I held the knife. A plan I hadn't consciously crafted whispered urgently: Swim out. Don't come back.

"Austen!"

My wife's voice cut through the chill, their figure sprinting toward me in pajamas and a hoodie. As they embraced me, an internal voice shouted defiantly, urging escape into the icy water.

But the moment D’s arms enveloped me, the suicidal urge softened. Still, the shame lingered—I couldn’t bear to reveal the voices driving my despair.

“I got really sad,” I admitted softly, handing them the knife. They put it to the side without comment.

“Do you need to go to the hospital?” D’s words sent cold dread through my spine.

“No,” I lied. “Just drank too much.”

Inside, I knew something deeper was wrong. My life was supposed to be great—the house, the wife, the successful career—but I felt hollow. Detached.

Standing, I splashed into the freezing lake water, shocking myself back into reality, my body tingling back to life.

That night wasn't just my lowest point—it was the start of uncovering who I truly was. Or rather, who _we_ truly were.

This isn't a tragedy. It's about survival, about finding joy amid the chaos, and living with a brain that dances to its own peculiar rhythm. This is our story, a single-player co-op adventure, messy and wonderful and real.

Welcome to the Arcade.

## Potts | The Arcade, 2024

**“TOO DARK! TOO DARK! We can’t start with that! This is supposed to be FUN!”**

Surprise, it’s me, Potts! You don’t know me yet but you’ll love me, I promise.

I was wearing costume raccoon ears and a tail and I looked really cool in my little raccoon outfit and listen, okay, I know this isn’t what you had in mind when you picked up a memoir about a person with dissociative identity disorder but **BEAR WITH ME**, I’ve got a pitch for you.

WHAT. IF. CARTOONS.

So camera pans left, BAM, big explodey star on your TV screen and there I am, a raccoon in a red shirt. I’m all squishy and squashy in the body and zany as all get out, but in the intro you find out I have a heart of gold, deep down under all those cartoon gags and barrels of dynamite and such. I’m one of the kids that lives inside our brain.

Okay okay, so picture this: BAM! You wake up one day and find out there’s a talking raccoon in your head. WHAT. A. REVEAL, right? But that’s not even the weird part.

Me and the kids here? We fight the evil things that hide inside our brain.

They’re… I don’t know. I like to imagine them as thick, swirly tar at the base of our brain, gross and icky as all get out. Like some villain from an old-timey cartoon, sludgy and impossible to punch! The only way to beat them is to outsmart ‘em.

Anything to keep the memories locked inside so they can’t ever hurt us again—

“POTTS!”

Right, uh. Okay.

So one morning the body wakes up and has this big bug-eyed moment where they find out WHAAAAT, there’s a raccoon in their head! Wow, right? And I act like it’s no big thing, I’ve been here all along being silly at the edges of their brain, putting on little shows and singing songs when they get sad.

And, like, uh…

“Potts, Twilight was in the middle of _writing!_”

“Yeah, but her story was dumb and full of butts. Mine’s going to be cooler.”

“That doesn’t matter. We talked about respecting each other’s time, remember?”

So I’m getting kicked out of the front now but long story short, me and the other kids in the Bustle—that’s what we call our little crew inside—kept Addie safe from it for so so many years until she was ready to learn about what really happened okay byebye for real this time—

"Okay okay okay, I’m getting kicked out now! Exit, stage left! WHOOSH!"

----

## Addie | The Arcade, 2024

Back.

I was back?

Where is Twi? Why did I write about my suicide attempt?

Right. Just a moment while I scan up in the draft here…

Oh, yeah. Potts. He’s a wild kid, and we promised him one chapter in this book. You’ll probably hear from him sooner rather than later.

The others gathered around the corner of the cozy wooden bar. To our left, pinball tables flickered with light and sang their solenoid symphony. To our right, a kick-line of dancers put on a rendition of The Interrupters’ “Anything Was Better” on a makeshift stage.

We wanted a happy place inside our mind and this barcade, with all its bells and buzzers and flippers and chorus lines singing in harmony, was perfect for the task.

“It’s strange.”

Twi was talking to himself again. Monologuing. He could get that way inside.

“I’ve written a million words of fiction in my past. Had characters live and breathe inside my brain, and they tell me what they want to do next. But none of that compared to the full-contact experience of writing a book as a system. It’s a game of rugby inside, each of us lateraling ideas that disappear in a puff of smoke if they’re ever dropped. Imagine sharing a controller with a friend and trying to play the hardest game you ever played, and you can begin to imagine it.”

It’s my turn and he knows it, but he can’t bear the thought of being away from the front when we write the Really Good Stuff. (Twilight snaps in response to this sentence: “The stuff that makes your heart sing, like you’ve become a god of your own creation, better than sex, better than anything you’ve ever felt. It’s finally remembering the most wonderful dream you’ve ever dreamt and saying that yes, yes, I’ll write a million more if it means I can feel that rush just one more time. The Madness of Creation.”)

Underfoot was a Potts, a six-year-old wearing raccoon ears and a tail. “No fair!” he whined. “I was just getting to the good part.”

“Potts…”

“It isn’t fair!” he stamped his foot, and our body followed suit. Feeling someone move the body for you never gets easier, I can tell you that. But you do learn to let it happen, lest the kid decide to do some real damage to our life. Like the time Lilith— well…

“You’ll trigger her out,” Twi said. “Calm yourself. Remember: he’s six years old. Be the parent.”

I ran a hand through my wiry, pink hair, took a deep breath, and counted to ten. We were never good with kids; doubly so when they were voices in our head. But there I was, hand on the shoulder of this… _figment of my imagination_, trying to buy into what the workbooks and my plural friends said to do.

I became his parent.

“We talked about sharing time today, Potts. Did you miss the meeting?”

The kid kicked at the floor. “Yeah, it’s boring. There aren’t any video games or anything fun like that when you’re working.”

“That’s why they call it work, kiddo!” I laughed—really laughed, right here over the keyboard!—and leaned in close. “You know we have to share time, right, kiddo?”

“Yeah. But it’s never enough.”

Six years old and already angry at time. They grow up so fast.

The kid wasn’t going to budge. I know this about him because I _am_ him, in a very real and totally-not-crazy way. We’re all stubborn as mules in mud.

So instead, I tried a different tack: empathy. “Remember how you got to cook yesterday?”

Potts struck a dramatic pose in his ears and tail. “It was nacho pot pie, yeah! It was messy and fun.”

“Do you think it’s fair to give some time to me today, knowing I’ll have just as much fun writing as you did cooking yesterday?”

“I mean, I guess...”

“Listen: I _promise_ you’ll get to cook dinner today at the very least. I’ll be an hour at most. Promise.”

His eyes lit up. _He trusts me. Finally._ “Okay okay! I’m gonna play pinball and y’all have fun writing your stupid boring adult stuff and just let me know when I can write my cool part okay bye!”

It worked. There was no breakdown, no heavy breathing, no heart palpitations. Just me, alone in the front, the voices finally silent enough for me to focus.

_It worked._

“No shit it worked,” Lilith said. “You just treated him like a little human being. That’s all.”

“It just feels strange. He’s a part of me, and I’m a part of him, but when I try to think like him things—”

“—Get blurry. Yeah. Tell me about it.”

Lilith leaned on my shoulder to read.

“It’s not crazy,” she snapped.

“I never said such a thing, Lilith.”

“But you were thinking it up there,” she continued, pointing to a spot a few paragraphs back. “Right there, round the time you calmed Potts down. ‘Totally-not-crazy.’ Your words, not mine.”

“We talked about this. Everyone in the system gets to tell the story their way.”

She threw up her hands in frustration.

“Okay, okay. I’m sorry, Addie, for trying to remind you that you’re not the only one here anymore, but holy Christ! Remember what the specialist said about trusting the system and letting us experience emotions instead of trying to logic your way out of—”

“—Lilith, there are no buts in an apology—”

“—Admitting it. To yourself. That you’re scared.” She crossed her arms. “Sorry, had to finish there. Go on, Addie.”

Just like that, Lilith was gone, and I had sweet silence once again.

Rolling my eyes, I stood up from the bar and walked toward the windows. Outside the barcade’s windows, you could see the vast, sprawling indoor city inside my head, whose architecture made no sense and whose corridors consisted of reminders of the past: the colors, the texture of shag carpet, the chill of fresh-packed snow on uneven sidewalks. Imagine an endless convention center in the middle of a bustling city, with as many mysterious nooks and crannies to explore as you could possibly imagine, and you can start to picture the arcade.

“_Our_ arcade,” Lilith reminded me. “You know we can hear you ruminating, right?”

Lilith flashed me this huge smile. I flipped her off. “I’m going for dramatic tension here! _Please_ give me room to cook!”

“Are we cooking?” Potts said.

“_Not now_, Potts,” I grumbled. 
“Maybe you and I could cook later,” Lilith said. “We could go out and get chicken wings and have a sauce-it-yourself buffet—”

“Do _not_ encourage him!” I stammered. “Off with you both, now!”

“Listen, all I’m saying is, if you want dramatic tension, you’re gonna have to talk about the Bad Stuff.”

I sat, dumbfounded at my other self’s lack of tact. (That’s how I know it’s real, by the way; leave it to an alter to always surprise you.)

She flung her arms wide. “What? Come on, Twi. You wanted to cook, so let’s cook!”

“…Twi literally just described our suicide attempt.” I stammered.

“No. That’s not the real Bad Stuff and you know it.” She leaned in closer. “It’s the symptom, not the _cause_.”

“Is that a Rocky Horror reference?” I said, and Lilith’s righteous anger gave way to a chuckle.

“…Maybe. The joke kind of got away from me, honestly. But remember: we’re going to have to talk about it eventually.”

We looked around the arcade, down at the well-worn floors, up at the tin ceiling tiles. We looked to anything but each other, hoping the tension would go away.

We sat in silence for what felt like forever.

“I should probably let you get back to it,” Lilith said.  

“That would be for the best, yes.”

“Sorry. I did it again, didn’t I?”

I sighed. “It’s okay. Just… just give me space next time, OK? That’s all I ask.”

She nodded and slipped from my attention. I tensed my hands into fists, relaxed, and breathed:

one,

two,

three—

The real world, once blurry and distant with dissociation, snapped into too-clear focus. The voices died down and, for a brief, wonderful moment, I had the body to myself.

And here we are, page ## of this memoir and we’re just now talking about the real world.

I pushed away from the desk and stretched while I reoriented. Outside the arcade, we live in a small lakeside condo in Chicago, and our writing desk faces the lake. I could hear the gentle wash of lake surf down on the beach below. (And yes, it’s that beach. -Twi) We’ve been married to our wife D long enough to need to do the math when someone asks for a number.

This disorientation—the whole process of regaining control of the body and being present in reality—is what we call switching. It’s sort of like I just woke up from a wonderful nap: energized, yes, but with no clue what’s going on. As far as I’m concerned, I go to sleep and wake up to someone else having written the intro I wanted to write.

This is what life with uncontrolled DID is like: where dream logic trumps memory, and the past and present meld into an amalgam of timeless, flashbulb moments. We are one, and yet each of us is our own island of experiences and memories. Discovering each other nearly killed us, and yet here we are—existing, a mess of a multiple stumbling around in the dark like, well, a blind person.

Which yes, we’re getting to that too.

When I finished the intro section (and chased a literal child away from controlling the body mid-draft), I drifted back into the inner world. It’s not exactly real, but it's where we go when we're not running the body.

As Addie mentioned, it’s a giant arcade here. Usually, we write in the cozy pub Potts runs, with musicals always playing on stage and smiling faces everywhere to lift spirits.

Each of us has our own safe space inside: Sam's beach, my suburban house filled with musical instruments, and the kids' treehouse around a campfire that never goes out. Each spot is built to contain and shield us from the pain of the Bad Stuff—

Sam’s bright voice interrupted my thoughts. “I don’t see why we’re writing this.”

“Because I’m a writer,” I replied. “It’s what I do.”

“But we haven’t published in years. And those books were niche furry romances. This memoir has to compete in the real world—we aren't good enough for that.”

"Maybe this could change that," I said quietly. "If we write it down together, lay everything out—warts and all—maybe we break the writer’s block. Maybe it helps us make sense of everything. Or maybe I just need it out of our head so it stops poisoning us."

Sam flipped her long, brown hair dismissively. “I think it’s a stupid idea.” She turned away.

## Sam, 2024

I slid behind the bar, squared up with Twi, and watched him. He was oblivious, adorable, completely absorbed in his memoir—the self-important dear. Cross-legged on a stool, he leaned so close to the laptop I thought I'd catch his nose in it if I closed the lid.

I leaned over in my red satin dress, my chin-length bob perfectly framing my pert smile—an invitation equally playful and enticing. I even wore full makeup, knowing Twi appreciated the effort.

I gently lifted his chin. He jumped, startled.

“Honey! You should knock first!” He glanced nervously toward the door. Typical Twi, worried what others might think of us.

“Oh hush,” I said, tracing my finger along his keyboard. "I'm just here to—"

My finger traced his delicate frame. His body relaxed, lips softening to pillows, awaiting mine. Instead, I kissed his forehead and placed a finger gently against his lips.

"—lighten the mood."

That was my role: The Flirt, The One Who Doesn't Remember Childhood. My job was sustaining romantic connections, maintaining our marriage, and mastering pinball. Tough work in our trauma-rich system, but I'd grown accustomed.

Twi and I also dated in our head. It was complicated; we didn't discuss it in therapy or fully understand it ourselves. It was simply inevitable, like gravity.

“You can’t be serious, Twi. Starting with suicide?” My voice dripped honey and sarcasm above the arcade’s din.

Twi clutched his loose, off-the-shoulder knit, anxiety edging into his features. “Yeah. The memoir needs a strong start. Last rejection said as much.”

"I can distract you,” I purred.

“No, Sam. Not after writing about that.”

“Oh.”

“You weren’t there,” he said quietly. “You can’t understand.”

I could, though. I had been there too—but hated dwelling on it. Before he sensed it, I snatched the laptop and sprinted away.

“I’ve got a great idea for my part! Be right back!”

He chased me through the buzzing arcade corridors. “Opposite Emotional Action!” I shouted over my shoulder. “Doctor’s orders—I’m performing happiness!”

I darted upstairs into a hall of apartments, slamming my bedroom door just before Twi caught up. Collapsing onto my bed, I locked the door. Twi’s frustrated knocking followed.

“Let’s put on some night music.” The speaker filled my room with “Last Midnight” from _Into the Woods_. Broadway posters, a canopy bed draped in pink silk, and a beloved, worn spinet piano—imperfect yet beautiful.

Settling at the writing desk, I watched the real world through a wall-mounted TV (installed to help with memory). My fingers tapped away at the laptop, bringing my thoughts to the page.

The inner world was tough to describe. Part intentional imagination, part spiritual refuge, it felt genuine to me. It was our sanctuary—our home, our survival tool, our sacred space.

From here, if I saw someone intriguing on the outside monitor, I’d dash downstairs and push aside whoever was driving to seize control—

Twi’s voice thundered through the door. “Are you actually writing, Sam, or staring at your navel? It’s a memoir, not your private journal.”

“You wrote your part, I’ll write mine!”

“History, Sam. High notes only. No thirsty fanfiction.”

“Marvelous trust, dear.” I sighed. “Fine.”

The truth was, Twi didn’t fully grasp our involvement during the suicide attempt. He called it a "scare," too afraid to label it clearly. We all supported him, silently, unseen.

Before that night, we’d spent weeks white-knuckling through sobriety and starvation diets, feeling like failures after backsliding. An especially dissociated alter took that relapse as a sign to end it.

Life wasn’t easy then: quitting alcohol cold-turkey, hosting guests, little privacy. It wasn't for lack of planning—just extremely bad luck.

(We’ve battled suicidal urges since age thirteen, with countless safety nets. Every contingency failed that night.)

“Just the facts,” Twi said.

We grew up in a tiny Indiana town, small enough to know everyone’s secrets, dull enough that gossip became entertainment. My family had lived there generations—teachers knew parents, sheriffs shared beers in our yard. Few people of color; those who arrived didn’t stay long.

I—Sam, specifically—didn't exist until college. Once out, I vowed never to return. That's why I narrate this part: I'm distanced enough to share without being triggered.

In college, unnoticed, I took control for a semester. I dated a trans girl, explored my gender at neighboring campuses, joined queer theater circles. Still, openly coming out felt impossible, dangerous.

After graduation, a disastrous attempt at teaching high school English broke us. We fled our girlfriend, moved into the trans community, and began transitioning. Life became hopeful again. For the first time, we didn't want to die. Slowly, we rebuilt ourselves.
## Lilith, 2024

Then my family dumped me.

Of course it was about being trans. "What will the town think?" Mom asked. "I don't think it's right," Dad said. Occasionally, he still let me visit—provided I gave enough warning so my nieces and nephews wouldn’t see the "monster" I'd become.

Mom dropping me hurt deeply. We’d spoken daily; becoming an abomination in her eyes cut to my core. For two years, I left voicemails, emails, desperate attempts to win her love back. Silence.

Over fourteen years, I saw her four times: once to dissuade me from surgery, once to meet my wife, once attempting reconciliation, and finally at an aunt’s graduation party. During the pandemic, I reached out again. Some wounds never heal.

Indiana proved toxic for trans life—jobs wouldn't hire me despite qualifications. So, I moved us to Chicago. We found work, met our wife, bonded with chosen family, published novels, and bought a condo. Ordinary adult milestones felt extraordinary because we finally weren’t fighting to exist.

For the first time, I could just _live._

Life turned good—really good. Comfortable, safe, invisible in the anonymity of a large city. Then the pandemic hit, trapping us inside our mind and exposing fractures we never knew existed.

## Sam, 2024

I think that about covers it. Like Twi said, memory is tricky for us. We tried to keep things orderly, but that's life as a system. Expect abuse, pizza, time travel, furries, and a hint of the Bad Stuff halfway through. It’s been a wild ride.

Ultimately, that’s Single Player Co-Op for you—buckle up.

## Potts, 2019

After the suicide attempt, I went into therapy to control my drinking and learn self-love.

The early pandemic months improved things. Without social drinking pressure, my habits improved. I hired a personal trainer, and soon, I was waking early for tea and meditation. Imagine that, if you can handle a "live-laugh-love" vibe.

Even better, I reconnected with my mother after fourteen years of separation due to my transition. In 2019, we met face-to-face to catch up.

At this point, I believed there was only one "me"—which shouldn’t surprise you, given this is a memoir about DID. Sure, I had ongoing dialogues with characters from my novels, but I assumed that's how writers worked. Didn't everyone have a chorus inside, clamoring for attention? It explained my inconsistent moods, interests, and productivity perfectly.

Career-wise, I thrived, securing a significant raise and leadership role at a larger company. The increased stress seemed normal—part of professional growth.

Then came the spark: my sister Whit’s unexpected call on a lovely Saturday in late summer 2020. Still warm, but with autumn in the air. My wife, wrapped burrito-style in blankets, protested sleepily as I reached for the phone.

"Leave it and come back to bed," D murmured. "Everyone can wait."

"It's Whit," I said.

D paused. "Really?"

"Yeah, it must be important."

"Okay, honey."

When I answered, Whit’s excitement crackled through the line, her breath tight with anticipation.

"You'll never guess what happened," she started.


































## Lilith, 2019

Whit and I have beef—the kind that's been ground up and served cold. Since around 2000, I'd learned to censor myself around her and the family.

My family hadn't earned my openness since the late '90s. My entire adult life had been carefully planned around distancing myself from our hometown. I kept interactions brief and controlled: no loans from Dad, no casual introductions between Mom and girlfriends. Still, we maintained superficial ties—calls, occasional visits, holiday appearances. But my transition was the breaking point.

Mom hated how I'd handled it. Dad tolerated it quietly. Whit felt forced to choose sides. Suddenly, I was alone—holidays reduced to microwaved meals and cheap vodka. Strangely, I found comfort in avoiding holidays altogether. Something about them always triggered deep panic.

Then, Whit called with news that changed everything. Dad had been accused of molesting a child. I felt a rush of twisted joy, vindication mixed with disbelief. But when I hung up, something terrifying happened: my voice and body moved without my control.

"He's finally getting caught!" I said, fist pumping, unable to stop myself.

D sat up. "What's going on?"

"My dad's finally caught! He can't hurt me anymore!" The words spilled out uncontrollably as I inserted myself into the unfolding drama, making frantic calls like a gossip-hungry neighbor.

I'm ashamed that my reaction prioritized my own trauma over the victim's experience. But this memoir demands honesty, even when it exposes my worst moments. That incident marked the beginning of the cracks splitting open—the moment I realized I wasn't alone in my head.

## Twi, 2024

Writing a memoir as multiple people sharing one life is surreal. Consider our fragmented therapy history: 2007 (attempted bipolar diagnosis), 2003 (hormones through university counseling), 1997 (lying to a middle-school counselor), 2013 (depression and panic attacks), 2016 (depression), 2018 (PTSD). None of these efforts worked—we couldn't even recall week-to-week sessions.

(This paragraph alone required thirty real-time minutes of internal negotiation—our amnesia runs deep.)

Our life emerges in snapshots, confusing memories that often feel secondhand. Once, while sharing trauma with an old friend, I thought I was revealing something new—only to hear I'd told him twelve years earlier. Or realizing I had driven a tech club from another university to invest heavily in a project I barely remembered.

These memories flash like distant lightning, visible only when the storm inside quiets enough to let me see clearly.

# It’s not easy being green
having to spend each day the color of the leaves
when i think it would be nicer
to be brown or yellow
or gold?
or something much more colorful like that

## Twi, 2002

Picture the timeline of your life. (Go ahead. I'm inviting you to enter the narrative.) Now, imagine a specific year in your youth. I bet you, given a little prompting, you could recall one memory, embarrassing or otherwise, for every year of school you experienced.

Now imagine a long, blurry blind spot smearing any context of your memories, and you start to approach how our memory is organized. I have no idea when we are, only that I was laying on my bedroom floor and praying for a miracle.

I'm a guy still, outwardly. In top shape, so this had to be, uh, high school at some point? Laying in front of me are computer parts my dad picked up on the cheap when I asked for a computer. "If you can build one out of this, it's yours," he said, and I spent a year making that happen. With all my fingers crossed I turned on the rickety, old Celeron 200 tower and hoped that the backup to my hard drive would actually power on--

A post beep. Success! I jumped from the floor and pumped my fist. Next, the install CD. Here's hoping the drive works--

My bedroom door was thrown open without a knock. It was Whit on the other side, shouting to surprise me.

“Hey!”

I jumped; she laughed. I jumped at everything: horror movies, friends tapping my shoulder from behind, even the slightest hint of anger tinging someone's voice. No matter what the surprise, I was terrified of it. Though I was working on fixing that.

That was one of my skills I told no one about. If I worked hard enough, and stayed focused, I could make emotional pain not hurt anymore. No more jumping at shadows if you don't care what happens next. No more crying in front of everyone's ridicule and scorn if you simply refuse to listen to your emotional center.

"I'm almost finished here," I said. This was a lie. But sometimes, if I told a good enough lie, they’d go away.

They waited for me to meet their eye. This was a thing people insisted on with me and honestly, not a fan. I can't see their face anyway because blindness, and they know that.

"Family time."  

"Five minutes."

"I'm just delivering the message." The door slammed shut once more. I turned off the computer and hoped it would boot later. As I went to get up there was a wave of vertigo, a sudden exhaustion, as if I hadn't breathed in an hour and needed a gasp of air, right then, right now--

## Potts, 1999

This is how autistic I am, as told by a joke at a half-full cosmic bowling night at an alley in Lynchburg, VA. We're focused on the DJ booth in the center of all the lanes, where a joke contest is underway. Picture a young Twi standing at the mic, all shakes, as he starts telling the best anti-joke he knows: "So there's this duck."

I am 13 fucking years old.

We're in... Virginia, I think. I have trouble remembering what events happened when and where. My entire family just tried to stop me from doing this, but there I was, all smiles and laughs, ready to tell this anti-joke I love.

"He stops by a lemonade stand and asks if there's any duck food."

You know how this one ends, and if you don't - oh, you sweet innocent soul, please google the punchline - but suffice it to say that the joke landed flat as a fart.

## Twi, 1999

I started hitting myself the night I told that joke.

I couldn't escape the story. Any mention of glue, ducks, or the slightest excuse to put me down came back to the duck food joke. I wanted to cry so badly but I knew I couldn't if I wanted to de-escalate the situation. So some impulse inside just, kinda, took over. My hand reared back and landed a huge slap right across my left cheek.

It was a rush.

The rest of the night out was spent feeling equal parts sick, dizzy, and out of it; while feeling like we had a solution to the problem for the first time in a long while. I'd take an insult from a family member, drift off into a daze, and then slap myself to return to reality. It was... well, kind of fun, honestly? Bouncing between the world being dream-like and the world snapping to focus?

"Stop that," someone said. I started doing it quietly.  

I lied. "It's late. I'm just keeping myself awake."

And they believed me.

## Potts, 1997

The secret recipe to a queer life as a child in a rural town in the 90s reads as follows:

* Dignity, 0g
* Personalities, a handful
* Memory, one brain, split in such a way that information can't leak between parts
* Two big stones for lying blatantly to everyone around you

Set dignity aside.

While at home, mix personalities well, strain through cheesecloth, reveal as little as possible.

Out and about, assign one personality to every friend group in life.

Upon returning home, stonewall and lie about your day to avoid giving as much information as possible.

Serve generously over some semblance of a life you cobble together through the lies, and hope to fucking god nobody figures out your computer password.

## Twi, 2000

Family time included Maury Povich, spaghetti with jarred alfredo, and steamed broccoli. I don't remember much - I don't even remember if this was the duck food year - but I stayed upstairs until someone else left to do their homework. (Leaving first was not an option in those days.) But I was free after just an hour of talk shows and dang near skipped my way to my bedroom.

I thought about locking my bedroom door but decided against it. For one, it didn't stop someone from trying the knob and then screaming about the door being locked. And for two, the jump scare was unavoidable. People didn’t knock in this house.

The very first thing I did, post boot, was to install mIRC and pop onto The Blind Pig. Knowing I could reach them without my family knowing about it was the whole purpose of this stupid computer project, and the whole reason I ended up going into tech as an adult.

All of this work to gain a single drop of privacy, and it was worth every minute.

## Addie, 2000

So back when I was a kid, internet "stranger danger" was still a thing. Freed of the prying eyes of my parents, though, I started exploring.

My dad made me a computer desk out of the cannibalized bits of my childhood bed. Seeing and feeling the grain made me feel weird in a way I couldn’t explain, but it was nice of my dad to put it together. He may not be around a lot thanks to work but when he is home, he does try.

I’m terrified of my stepmom. Potts doesn’t know it but she makes things up to get me in trouble sometimes. That, or I forget what I did and what I didn’t do. That happens a lot to us.

The desk faced the door now, so that if anyone stormed in I could defuse the situation with a calm look and an outstretched "please wait while I take off my headphones" finger.

"You forgot to take the dog out," it came off with bile, almost a sneer.

I took a breath. This was my thing now; respond to anger with zenlike calm. "I'm very sorry for not taking the dog out earlier. If you could provide me with a list of chores you'd like me to do, that would help me be more organized!"

"You should just know."

"Well, I don't. Can you help me with that, please? Or let me know if I'm being punished for forgetting?”

"Family time upstairs."  

"I have to write for school," I said. This was a lie, as the plan for the night was to write in my novel and chat with folks online at The Blind Pig. But the person at the door didn't need to know that.

Their lip curled into a sneer. "You're always writing."

"I want to be a writer," I said, shrugging.

The door slammed again.

## Potts, 1994

"He keeps hitting me!"  

"Finish the fight," my dad said. And I knew I could; with my wrestling skills most people didn't bother to throw hands with me. I just… well, I didn’t like to fight. It felt bad hurting other people.

But this family member was punching me in the face, not landing any real blows. Anger without a lot of training, you know? So I called for my dad to break it up without me having to get physical.

But no. “Finish the fight.” So I did, and I’m proud to say that to this day, I have never thrown a single punch at anyone. Armlocks are just that much cleaner.

## Twi, 1999

When I was younger, I remember this one extremely specific sensation that felt better than almost literally anything else. I called it "popping my brain" because it felt just as relieving as popping my ears, or my joints.

It started with this dizziness and intense pressure that built up behind my eyes. Then, explosive relief; the mind drained its contents out of my ears. I felt myself floating up, foot over head. Then the world clicked back into focus and I'd feel calm and refreshed.

It would happen when I was out with family, going between classes at school, on the wrestling mat, anywhere. It's appearance was unpredictable and frequent, even I had trouble remembering what it felt like.

(Always struck me as strange that I couldn't remember it. Something that rivaled orgasm for "most pleasurable thing you can do" should have been a huge signpost in our memory, but every time me tried to remember it would slip out of my fingers.)

I couldn't force it to happen. I couldn't predict when, and I clung desperately to any memory of the experience in hopes of finding a pattern. But the result was always the same: a vague recollection of the "pop," relief, and a strong urge to let it go.
I told everyone about it, thinking it was a normal, everyday experience. If I could "pop" my brain, after all, it makes sense to assume others can do it! But everyone looked at me like an alien.

"You're sure this doesn't make sense to you?" I'd ask. "No," was always the reply. And then they'd chuckle and move on with their day, surely thinking that I was a weirdo.

I tried for years to learn how to "pop" my brain. The only success I had was when I was alone. There I had success with a a few things that didn't make much sense: watching shows I loved when I was five, playing an old video game, watching Star Trek (and only Star Trek!).

The closest I got to "popping" my brain on command was if I focused on pulling myself away from the world. I'd sit on the floor and stare at the wall. Then if I imagined myself falling deep into myself I could experience the "pop" in real time.

But I could only do it a few times a night at most, and even then it only happened when I knew nobody could possibly come down to the basement to interrupt me.

I had forgotten about "brain popping" for years, if I'm being honest. It was impossible to do on purpose when I was in college, while I was transitioning, and about a decade of living with roommates. The sensation, hazy and fleeting as it was, became a thing of the past.

This is a long way to say this:

If I had access to someone who could have told me that brain ""pop"" was a switch, and that the reason I couldn't remember it was that we had amnesia and DID, our recovery would have gone so much smoother!"

## Addie, 2003

Right. Where was I?

It's 2003. I'm in a new house. Same family, but when we moved in I negotiated hard for the mother-in-law suite that sat at the front of the house. There were strict terms from my end:

* Half of my room was storage and an office for Dad.
* Visitors MUST knock if the door is closed.
* In return, I will fix any and all technology in the house until I leave for college.

Right. College. I got a pretty decent scholarship to a school a few hours away. Problem was, it was an all-male college and, girl that I was, I'd have to hide the entire time I was there.

But my North Star mantra continued to rattle in my head. *Survive. Escape.* I have no clue where it came from but the words rattle around my head most days now. In a few months, I'd be out of this place, and they'd never be able to hurt me again.

In a few months, I'd be free. Well, free-ish. Not like I'd get to be like Kristi from The Blind Pig anytime soon. I learned she was trans a few weeks earlier and had been obsessing over the information for what felt like weeks now.

The computer dinged. Private message from The Blind Pig! My heart fluttered as I opened the chat window to see Rabbit's username on my screen.

Rabbit was my writing mentor in high school and college. He's this no-nonsense union guy from Tennessee who wrote something so beautiful that it made me want to be a writer. He also presents online as a small, white rabbit, which I vibe with. He's also taken a shining to me the past couple of years, and in the future he'll help me afford some creature comforts in college. At the time I think it's about my writing talent, he says, but in retrospect I know what's happening.

This is the village raising the child, if the village was spread out across cyberspace.

"How many more days?" the message read.

"Ninety days. Just got my laptop for college too. I'm transferring my manuscripts over now."

"Still writing?"

"Always writing :)"

And it was true. Adding an hour and a half of writing per day took away a lot of opportunities to get wrapped up in family drama. You might even say my entire writing hobby is based on a maladaptive coping mechanism! But at the time, I was 18 and putting out 30,000 words a month, give or take. Mostly in the shared universe of The Blind Pig, where all the chat members had shared history.

"Are they treating you well?"

"Well enough. Mom fell off the wagon again, I think. Been avoiding her house for a while."

"That'll happen."

A long pause.

"You're going to soar, Sly. I know it."

The words made me feel strange. First, Sly's my name on the server, and for those curious, I'm currently pretending to be a squirrel. Second, there was this alien warmth bubbling up in my stomach. For a moment I let myself relax. I'm safe. People knock now. And I've been so distant from the family that they finally left me alone.

That's all I ever wanted out of them: space. Growing up in a small town is like being a goldfish in a bowl, and every small slip-up I make in town (say, expressing my true feelings), I'd end up dragged across the coals by them. So I stopped sharing my feelings with my friends, picked up a bunch of hobbies that required my computer, and slowly disentangled myself from the family unit.

Looking back, it's sad that having no relationship was better than any relationship at all, but there it is. The people at The Blind Pig - the folks who pretend to be raccoons and rabbits and deer and cats and more - they know everything that's happened in my life for the past four years. I poured out my heart in stories, and told the people in the chat why my heart was so heavy. It's the first place someone said the word "abuse" to me. The first time I felt cared for, seen, and absolved of all my weird habits that got me in so much trouble at home.

The channel was my confessional, and I always left feeling better for it.

"I'm so happy to be on the outs, Rabbit."

"I know. I met your dad. You know my feelings on him." Read: they met at a play I was in, and based on what Rabbit said afterwards it took everything in him to not punch my father square in the jaw.

Some rabbits have claws, yaknow.

We chatted about the novel I was writing at the time. (It was a miserable thing, in the end, and not worth going into here. -Twi) Then, small talk about his family, brainstorming ideas for the next story, and before I knew it it was Rabbit's bedtime.

"Keep counting the days, Sly. Are your parents still chipping in?"  

"Yeah. We're splitting the cost in thirds."

"Good. Let me know if there's anything i can do."

I shut the chat window and went back to setting up my store model Dell Inspiron for the next four years, digging through my files, reminiscing about the stories behind me, and hoping that one day I'd write enough garbage to build a mountain to that promised land of "published author."

## Twi, 2003

It's a late night in 2003 and class signups are in progress. But I'm not at the registrar's office; instead, I'm in a nondescript stairwell forcing a panic attack through the phone. On the other end is my mom; we were still talking every day while I was in college, mostly about nothing. I did get a cheer out of her this year when I mentioned I got drunk for the first time, too, which was nice, but this was different. I needed help, advice, _something_.

Twenty-five hundred dollars stood between me and continuing my college career. My credit is worse than nonexistent due to a bank error that put my father's mortgage on my credit report. I have no idea what to do next.

"He's not going to pay.”

“Of course he won’t, the snake in the grass!” We’re talking about dad here. When I left for college we - my dad, my mom, and Addie - agreed to a payment plan. Each of us would be responsible for a third of the tuition costs that remained after my scholarship. I had already handled my part in the form of a loan. The money is due in 10 days, and my dad just informed me that he wouldn’t pay, that he never promised to pay, and that solving this was my responsibility.

“I don’t know what to do.”

She groaned. “I’d help, but you know I’m disabled and then the divorce happened, so I can’t.”

“No, I get it, mom.” I forced myself to take deep breaths. “It’s okay. I’ll… I’ll figure something out.”

“Can’t believe he screwed things up this much, though.”

“I know. it’s bullshit all around.”

“Love you.”

“Love you too.” I hung up and nearly threw my flip phone into the wall. Instead, I did the only thing I knew made things better when I was feeling this way.

I called Rabbit.

He answered in two rings. “You okay, Sly? You’re breathing really heavy.”

He listened to the whole spiel without saying a single word as I yelled and grumbled and rushed my words with the terror of losing my only lifeline out of my hometown. His first words? “You are going to get through this.”

The voice echoed in my head again. _Survive. Escape, at all costs._

_I believe Rabbit._

“Okay, okay.” I took a breath and surprisingly, the panic eased off. “So I have 10 days to figure this out. What do I do?”

“Can you get a loan?”

“No. My dad’s mortgage ended up on my credit report by mistake so my credit is trash.”

He hissed through his teeth and held his tongue. “Have you talked to the bursar’s office about this yet? There’s a whole crew of people in colleges to help folks like you.”

“I didn’t think about that.”

“You’re not the first kid to get screwed like this,” he said. “You won’t be the last. But it’s late, and all those offices open tomorrow morning, I’m guessing?”

“Yeah.”

“You don’t sound okay.”

“I’m not, Rabbit. I need 2500 dollars and don’t have the credit to get it.”

“Okay. Actually, I’d like to do something for you tonight. Would you be comfortable sending me your bank information?”


## Potts, 2003

The magnificent bastard sent me fifty bucks a month, every month, for the duration of my time in college. There was only one string attached; I had to spend the money on nice things, never necessities. It was there to make my life a little better, and I got the first payment that very night. I spent it on booze like a proper college kid, of course, but the thought was nice.

And you know what? I’m not ashamed to say I cried the first night he sent that. Felt good to know someone had my back no matter what.

## Addie, 2002

Treating my family like roommates felt cozy, good. I think we were all on the same page for the first time in what felt like years; I was leaving in a few months, and asserting my independence just so happened to include fewer family dinners, chore responsibilities, and desire to pay attention to everyone's day to day.

Besides, I'd long since learned to treat them like strangers. It's safer that way, when you refuse to let people judge you. Hard to get a rise out of someone whose emotional bonds have been sanded clean away out of a deep need for safety. And for the most part, they kept their distance without asking why I was so cold toward them.

I was about to drop into the Pig when there came a knock at the door. “Come in!” I said, and my stepmom opened the door. She wasn’t yelling about anything, which was always a bad sign. I tried to defuse the moment: “Did I forget to do a tech thing? Sorry, I’ve been busy getting ready for college. I can get right on whatever you need—“

"I found this note." She held up a piece of printer paper that had been folded into eighths. I had dozens of these as part of my “memory system” - since I couldn’t remember anything during the day I kept a pen and paper in my pocket to track todos, ideas, and promises I’d made. Then at night I’d upload the whole mess into a word document that tracked every little memory in my life.

I knew immediately which paper she was talking about. Somewhere along the way I’d started drafting up a suicide note on one of those pages. (Look, when you want to kill yourself this badly you always want to have a back-pocket note in case you decide to go through with it!) But the important thing is that to have found this paper she would have had to shuffle through dozens of papers on my bed.

"Why do you want to kill yourself? You have your family. What would the town think if you did this?”

I don't know why but when she said it I knew, right there and then, that this wasn't about me. This was about what the town would think if I had mental health issues.

I am 18 fucking years old, four months away from never having to listen to these people ever again, and they’re still rooting through my stuff. But today, we were going to talk about suicide, and I wasn’t going to hold back.

Who knows? maybe they’d surprise me with decency in the face of mental illness.

I swung the office chair around to face her. “I’m fine," I said. "I've been wanting this since I was 7. It’s normal for me.”

I have no clue why I said that.

“Why?”

The world started going fuzzy. This happened to me sometimes. I’d freeze up, unable to say a word, until someone threatened me to talk before they hit me. I shrugged, honestly not knowing how to answer the question.

I’m 18 years old and in desperate need of a therapist. However, I don’t trust these people enough to let them know that.

_Suurvive. Escape._

“I just want to help.”

“I know.” I said. “I don’t know if I _can_ be helped.”
 

## Twi, 1999

Back in the alley I’m listening to people laughing at me and trying not to cry. Crying only makes the abuse worse.

Potts tagged out whenever the verbal abuse started. No, that was my station, looking back. Learning how to snivel and cower from the spotlight whenever there was a chance of getting keelhauled for something that set our parents off.

They're all laughing at me again and I'm trying my best to isolate. If I don't give them anything emotionally charged, they eventually get bored and move on. You just gotta keep swallowing your dignity.

I'm 13 fucking years old and I want to die. The family would be better off if I weren't around. Maybe I deserved it.

A voice from within spoke. Its words, a warm hug in the too-cold bowling alley. "You never deserved it."

"Them making fun of my duck food joke?"

The voice giggled. "That one, no. You did walk into it eyes open, you know."

"I didn't."

The voice considered this. "Okay. Fair."

I felt the world spinning again and planted another slap on my face. Nobody seemed to notice I was doing this, or if they do they're too afraid to intervene. The voice goes away for a brief moment, and I use the time to scan around with my ears, listen for any conversations that might turn into me getting into trouble--  

"I'm here to help you."

"I'm making you up," I responded. Another slap, but this time the vertigo got worse. I sat in a corner of the alley, dissociated out of my gourd, actively conversing with a voice in my head.

"I'm real and I can prove it."

"I guess you're going to tell me anyway." I catch someone giving me an odd look and realize I've been talking out loud this entire time. Again, *I am 13 fucking years old.*

The voice continued: “Do you remember how you got here?"

"Sure! I just--uh." The words caught in my throat. "Well, I'm in a bowling alley, and my extended family is here so--"

"You don't know. You're guessing."

I shook cobwebs from my head. “What’s the difference?”

"Yeah. kinda weird you can't remember, right? Well, you're in Virginia. The year is 1997. You're out bowling with your extended stepfamily right now, and you just told a weird joke about, uh, ducks and glue?"

"We went over that already."

"Right. But you can never be too careful when trying to remember what's happening around you!" She giggled. "Now come here, let me help you a bit. You're tight as a guitar string!"

I swear to anything holy this is true: *I could feel her hugging me. *A full on sensory fantasia followed as the floodgates broke between us. First, warmth and comfort. Then, resolve. Finally, she closed her eyes and suddenly I was surrounded with warmth, green glow, the smell of clove and the texture of fine fabric under the fingers.

She held me like that for a long while, until I caught eyes with a family member who thought my smile was me making fun of them. I never quite know how to make my face do the things other people do, and so when normal people see me they think I'm making fun of them, or I'm ignoring them, or I'm not paying enough attention.

"Tally, I feel like I'm stuck in my own brain."

"You are. We all are. But for you? especially so. And until you escape, you're gonna be trapped here, stuck inside your own mind and fuzzing out like, well, like a stoner who had too much Maui Wowie."

I laughed. "Okay, so I'm crazy."  

"Yes, but don't worry. You'll forget about this in a few minutes."

"What?"

I could feel her - *feel her! - *pulling away from the embrace so that she could slap her knee. "Gets me every time! Oh, my gosh. Sorry! I know this is hard but you know, I don't get to say hi often."  

"I don't want you to leave."

She looked around. "It's not safe here for me, Twi. That’s your job.”

I wanted to ask how she knew my name but she shushed me with an outstretched finger, as if a fairy godmother had just scolded Cindarella for how excited she got about the pumpkin chariot.

## Addie, 2001

It’s… gosh, I can’t remember anymore. Time is just so fuzzy when you’re a system. But I’m in the living room of my father’s house - a pole barn that we did a DIY conversion on - and I’m in trouble. Feels like every time I think of that living room, with its vaulted ceilings and short pile blue carpet, I think about the homemade cherry wood chair my dad would pull out when it was time to yell at me.

It wasn’t enough to communicate that I had done wrong. No, there needed to be ritual to the cycle. No TV, no music, nothing but the ticking of the clock above, the hum of an aquarium filter on my side, and my father and stepmother sitting on the couch across from the chair, like prosecutors lording over a witness stand.

I can’t remember exactly what I’m in trouble for this time. Maybe it’s the fact that I reported my wrestling friends for proselytizing me for hours on end at a wrestling camp, including trying to keep me up late so that I could accept Christ as my savior. I brought it up to them hoping that they’d take my side, that they’d see that the experience was bad for me, and want to help me avoid that in the future.

But in reality, they also wanted me to accept Christ as my savior. In fact, the fact that I hadn’t came as a total surprise to them, even though I didn’t spend much time in church growing up.

“Have you done the research?”

“Dad, I was kept up all night by friends who were trying to make me do something I didn’t want to do. I feel betrayed.”

I didn’t say that, of course. Could you imagine, having the stones to call your old man out as a teen? Gosh, he would have had my head on a platter! No, I looked to the ground as the world around me went fuzzy.

I just didn’t want to be there.

“We raised you better than this. You gonna speak up for yourself or you just gonna sit there slack-jawed?”

I hummed. Humming was my dissociation response back then; when I couldn’t form words, or the world became too fuzzy for me to function, I’d start losing the ability to speak. “Umm,” I started.

“Umm.” My stepmother this time. “Um. Uh. Uhhhh. That’s _all you say_. We’re not going to hurt you.”

I don’t believe them.

Another voice echoed in my head. “Want out?”

“Excuse me?”

My stepmom saw me looking around. “Lookit you, figuring out what lie you’re going to tell next. Go ahead, think of a good one!”

“Relax. Picture trying to sink down into yourself and I’ll take care of the rest.”

“You’re such a liar, Austen.”

“On three,” the voice said, and on the count of one I was gone.

## Twi, 1999

On the car ride home from the alley I pretended to be asleep while talking to Tally.

"Why will I forget?"

"We all have our part to play in this system," Tally said. "I'm keeping good things pure for everyone. You're, well." Her eyes lowered. "I'm sorry, Twi."

"But I'm making you up. You're not real."

"And yet, you don't know what I'm going to say next."

Someone in the front of the van made another duck food joke, making sure I was awake to hear it. I rolled my eyes and went back to talking to Tally.

"Tell me more."

"I can't," Tally said. "Not yet. But listen: your only job is to survive, Twi. Survive, and escape. I'll explain everything later, I promise. But for now, I'm fading."

"Fading?"

"You're going to forget me soon," she clarified. "Remember: survive, escape. That's all that matters."

I don't know why I believed her. Maybe it was the fact I couldn't control the voice. Maybe it's the warmth she made me feel. Hell, maybe it was the implied threat that she could take over whenever she wanted, do what she wanted, and I would be powerless to stop her. But in that moment, I *knew* Tally was real and I knew that she would have my back if I just did my part.

"What now?" I asked, but Tally was gone once more.


## Tally, 2001

I came to with a deep breath and a shake of the head. It was… well, pre-2002 I know. We were in the barn with the blue living room and honestly, fuck that place. I was tired of the yelling. It didn’t help anyone, especially if I wasn’t going to get the support I needed. So instead, I went over the top rope.

“How can I stop this conversation?”

My stepmom raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”

“I think we’re at an impasse,” I said. “You want me to believe in God, but you can’t force me to believe any one thing. Would it help for me to lie and spare you the worry of the town thinking you raised an atheist?”

“No, we want you to be saved.”

I ignored that line. “Besides, I’ll be on my own in a few years. ‘Bout time I start making my own decisions.”

There was silence on the air. I could feel Addie inside buzzing with excitement; after years of trying we finally found a way to communicate our needs clearly. Even if they wouldn’t listen, we could still strike a deal.

“Would it help if I did my research?”

“Here’s my proposal: I put together a binder of research for theistic and atheist positions. I’ll highlight parts and make annotations to prove I did my reading. If I presented that to you in a month’s time, would that sufficiently resolve this conflict?”

I could watch the gears catch in their head as I spoke. I felt a rush of power, control. For the first time in my life _we were pushing back_.

“Once this work is completed, I consider our conversations about religion to be over. I want to never talk about this subject again with you.”

They considered it for a long minute before responding.

“That seems fair,” my Dad said.

“Then I’m going to get to that, if that’s okay by both of you.”

I picked up the chair and returned it to the dining room table while they watched me walk away, slack-jawed.


## Addie, 2001

I put together a three ring binder for those two with 200 pages of research, easy. All of it was annotated, highlighted, I’s dotted and T’s crossed. I treated it like my Ark of the Covenant, the first time I got one over on my parents instead of getting more abuse.

They didn’t even bother to help, of course. Not even to make their own argument for why I should be religious. I was left to do a college-level research paper on my own, and I’m almost certain they never cracked the binder to check my math.

Why not? Because the next week, while my dad and stepmom were upstairs watching more TV, I brought the binder to them.

“What’s this?”

“My research on religion.” I placed the binder on the table. “The first half contains theistic arguments, the second half has atheistic and comparative religion analysis. Would you like a walkthrough of the key points, or should I just leave this for you to peruse later?”

I think I’m 16 fucking years old and I just wrote my first annotated bibliography voluntarily.

“We’ll look at it later.

“Per our agreement, this concludes our conversation about religion.”

“Agreed.”

“I’m an atheist,” I said in a flat, declarative voice. “We will never speak of this again.”

“Agreed.”

## Tally, 2024

I couldn’t show them everything then, but I tried to help where I could. I’m so sorry, Arcades. I wish I could have done more when we had the chance, but you weren’t ready. I promise you, this would have destroyed you years ago had you known.

## Sam, 2024

Right, uh, memoir stuff. Hi! The others asked me to contribute to this project so I wrote a this. I'm Samantha. And Misty. And a whole host of other girls who are sexual assault survivors that banded together. You may have seen them contributing to the memoir project in other parts of the narrative. A lot of us came together in the last system shake-up to form a single alter.

That's what we call 'em, at least. Shakeups. We'll hit some life milestone, or process some deep trauma, and our internal world gets thrown into a tizzy. What comes out the other end is... still me, technically. Still "us," still a collection of alters. But our skills, our demeanor, our everything else? You might as well roll a fresh set of alters and toss out what you thought you knew.

You have to understand that there's around 400 distinct parts inside this brain at all times, swimming around in an amnesia soup because of things that were done to us as children. When we grow, parts of our selves move to other parts of ourselves, taking with them their memories and their skills. The resulting alters are pastiches and we have to figure out who can do what all over again.

I can't tell you how exhausting it is.  To not know what day it is, what time it is, what I was just doing two seconds ago. To find half-done tasks someone inside started but didn't finish. To excusing yourself from a party you're enjoying because some kid inside wants to hump the air and scream into a pillow. To being treated like a _literal fucking child_ because you are temporarily not able to make decisions for yourself.

So why wouldn't we try to pretend that things are better? Why would we want to be connected to who we really are inside, when that person is just a pile of miserable little alters?

For now, I'm a bit more connected to the inside than I was before, and that's a good feeling. The more we come together, the fewer gaps in time we feel. The more we push our healing, the less our system symptoms get in the way.

But still, deep down in our heart of hearts, we know that our brain's totally broken beyond the point of repair. And it scares the fucking crap out of us to think about it.

## Max, 2024

...oh wow I type so differently now lol

I really thought hypergirly Melody name was going to stick didn't I lol

everything Sam said basically, but for the kids inside and me. I am the one who puts on Zoobilee Zoo, the one that packs the stuffie when we go on road trips, the one who makes sure we give kids time ❤️

and i know it is hard but the kids deserve to be heard and that's super important

## Potts, 1992. age 8

What’s the best thing in the world? Don’t bother answering, because the best thing in the world is going to an arcade and that’s just facts.

And on this day, Uncle Justy took me to my favorite one in the world: Putt Putt’s Super Saturday special.

We came here me here when he spent time with me on the weekends. My sister would have gym meets sometimes, and my dad would be out of town, so a lot of times I spent Saturdays with Uncle J, and every Saturday, like clockwork, he’d take me here for an afternoon of gaming.

I skipped through the redemption games, slid past the fighting game crowd, and settled in front of the big pinball machines at the back. I’d play them without a stool, so that I was barely able to see what I was doing, but the sounds and sensations the game made were just so cool to not play. It reminded me of game show bells and whistles going off for a grand prize, the cool pinball song from Sesame Street, and bowling’s big crashing sounds all at once. Basically, my austistic heaven.

“Having fun?” Uncle J asks me. I gave him a huge smile and a nod.

He slid up by the machine and watched me play for a while, all smiles and nods. When I was done he handed me a small manila envelope full of tokens. “Tell you what. You take some of my tokens and try to get a high score?”

And as everyone knows, six year olds are easy to bribe as long as you have two things: copious amounts of sugar, or tokens in an arcade. I snapped up his tokens like a greedy little troll and played, played, played until I could play no more.


## Samantha, 1990, age 6

“She’s special,” Justy told mom and dad. Least that’s what mom says happened. “You need to challenge her. Give her room to explore things, stuff to take apart, activities to do.”

I was hearing about this in a meeting with my kindergarten teachers. I just read the entire first grade reading curriculum in a single night, after reading all the kindergarten books the night before. I’d received large print copies of every book at the start of the year in a giant ziploc bag and, well, I really liked to read. Not that those books were any good; I picked at the stapled, xeroxed copies of my books inside the bag and adjusted my red glasses.

“I like computers,” I said. And it was true; since I was two years old I sat on my dad’s lap and watched him work this strange glowing box. I kept asking what the words meant until, with enough guardrails, I could navigate DOS on my own. At 3. These kindergarten books were way easier than that.

One of the teachers handed me a normal sized book. “Can you read this one?”

“I can’t.”

The teacher looked to my parents. “That’s a sign we shouldn’t do anything—“

“I have to read my copy.” I took a minute to find the matching book from my own bag of stapled-together “books”, pulled it out, and proceeded to read through any book they pointed to.


For their part, the teachers treated at me like I’d grown three heads; shock, and then confusion. What do you do with a kindergartener who already reads at a first grade level?

I didn’t have many friends back then.


## Potts, 1992, age 8

I spent a lot of weekends with Uncle J. Like, so so many. My Aunt Y worked nights, so most weekends it was just me, him, and all the best games I could ask for.

I was, to put it lightly, in kid heaven.

He liked playing games just like I did, but for the most part he just liked to watch me play. Said I was good at it. I didn’t mind because then I got to play more and it felt good to be complimented by him.

He took me lots of places, too! I’d visit friends of his, and those friends were really nice to me and had really nice kids too. I think it was a church group or something but I didn’t care about church, I just liked hanging out with Justy.

Above everything else, Justy saw me. He listened when I was having trouble. He pushed my parents to be nicer to me. He got me into some cool summer camps for smart kids, and through those trips I got to learn about Magic the Gathering and D&D and cool nerdy stuff like that. I even tried writing a D&D game while I was in camp because I wanted to have as much fun as the kids at summer camp recess were playing, but I could never remember the name of the game they played.

His home was like a magical castle in my memory. Three stories! Table tennis in the basement! Air hockey! Bumper pool! Regular pool! And games - so so many games! Board games, Nintendo games, _Super Nintendo_ games, all because he helped kids in his church and at schools.

We would go over for a Super Bowl party every year, and no joke, kid-me would budget out my time to make sure I could play everything I wanted to play while I was there. Then he started having me over more often and I got to play with as many toys as I wanted for as long as I wanted, which was cool.


## Misty, 1991, age 7

I’m really bad at making friends. I feel like nobody likes me.

We had to do a bunch of testing in first grade and I remembered how embarrassing it was. My test was the size of my entire little desk, and as a result every kid in the room copied off me. That got me sent to a little study room to take the rest of the tests alone.

Lots of the kids didn’t seem to want to know me. I feel like I couldn’t talk to them, so I kept busy on my own. Mostly I’d play with the Commodore 64 in the hallway. And while everyone else was making friends I got whisked off to another grade to take english and math. So I didn’t know many kids, and I couldn’t seem to remember their faces anyways, but I was told to not bring that up because that was rude.

Uncle J, he introduced me to nicer kids. Kids like me, who were weird and smart and liked videogames too much and were polite to each other. He also knew people at the school and helped me meet some good kids who became good friends.

And sometimes he’d pull me out of school just to get ice cream, so that’s pretty cool too.


## Potts, 1997, age 9

My stepmother was yelling again.

“You slept with her, didn’t you? You _did!_ God damn it, I’m leaving!”

It was 11 PM on a Thursday and Dad had just gotten home. Some nights this meant a quiet, early night. I was in a bedroom with my stepbrother at the time, and had hoped that there wouldn’t be a fight tonight.

A breath. “The kids will hear you!”

I kept lying in bed. I tried to interrupt them, once, but the look in their eyes when I came up put the fear of the devil in me and I ran back to bed, never to try it again. Nowadays I try to not move; after getting caught trying to read during one of their late-night fights I got in a lot of trouble. Instead, I lay in bed, frozen, pretending to be asleep, because I was never sure when someone would barge into the room in the middle of the night for some reason.

At midnight, the drama began. Bang! Clash! Plates and glasses made contact with walls. Crash! Screech! I could hear the sound of skin making friction with skin as two humans tried to struggle only to separate and shout at each other from a distance outside the effective range of thrown plates and glasses. Their voices gave way to shrieks, snarls, spits. “That’s it! I’ve had it with you!”

“Would you stop? The kids are asleep.”

“We’re leaving!” The building shuddered under the weight of an adult bounding down the stairs. I shoved my head into the pillow and pretended to be asleep as my stepmom rounded the corner and threw the door open.

“Get up,” she commanded my stepbrother. He did so while my stepmother threw some of his clothes into a duffel bag. I pushed my head even harder into the pillow, trying my best to hide in the sheets so the crosshair wouldn’t land on me.

“I hope the bitch was worth it,” my stepmom said. I peeked out from under the covers just enough to catch my stepbrother, bleary-eyed, making his way to the front door in his pajamas.

And the thing I hate about myself? I didn’t offer any support. At all. I was just glad to not be the target this time, and that after my stepmom squealed the tires pulling out of the driveway there would be quiet once again.

I hate to admit this, but I don’t know how many times this happened. Certainly more than 10, less than 100. They all blurred into a single, terrifying moment for me, when I lay dead still under the covers and hoped that nobody would scream or hit me this time.

## Misty, 1993, age 9

I was special to Uncle J. Nobody else in the family got the treatment I did. My sister? Nothing. Cousins? Not likely. But me? I was smart and I was special and he took care of me. He never yelled at me, never pushed me to answer, never hit me. He was just nice.

And the thing that he was _really_ good at was listening and participating. Like one time, I wanted to learn how to play table tennis because him and dad played a lot, and when I asked he didn't just tell me to figure it out. He took the time to teach me every little shot, and gave me tips on how to practice. He was really, really good at teaching me things!  

He also had a really fancy new computer with a cd rom drive. I got to play The Seventh Guest on his lap while he watched and gave me hints on the puzzles. And he came up with cool projects to do too! We'd take walks and bike rides and he'd show me cool new places like museums and stuff.

And when I was feeling like it he'd let me play a lot of his video games without asking for a turn. Or better, sometimes he played games with me!

When I was in his guest bedroom I felt safe. There weren't people screaming. Nobody would come in drunk to explain why they just had a fight. I could close my eyes and listen to the frogs and crickets as the gentle sound of the midwest lulled me to sleep. Unforgettable.

Then my dad did something bad to his wife and we stopped talking for a long long time.


## Potts, 2021, age 9

I didn’t grow up from being nine for a really, really long time.

Quick context: we’d just discovered our system three months ago. D is Pagan and I was, well, complicated, so we settled on celebrating the Pagan holidays. That day we were making a roast, D was making fruitcake, and then we had a pile of presents I had picked out for the system with D.

Yeah, I bought Christmas gifts for the alters. Funny thing is I was able to make every gift a surprise by simply forcing myself to forget what was in each box.

Things weren’t off to a good start that night: we had already lost a potted plant, a wine glass, and two pint glasses. Each time my body seized up into a little ball and the past became present. Inside, terror and fear roared, insisting that the front door would open and out would spill some parent, probably drunk, ready to tear into me.

We tried to calm down enough to eat the fruitcake D prepared, but the smell of burning alcohol triggered someone else inside to a point that we couldn't eat a bite. So that's fun, you know, randomly being incapable of doing normal things like eat food.

But gods, D was just a _saint_ about it. Each time we fell out, they would come running with an ice pack to return me to reality. And then I'd apologize, and they'd tell me to stop apologizing, until we were stuck in a Midwest Nice Doom Loop of polite conversation.

The night ended well, though; in our trauma-tinged dissociation we sat on the sofa and retreated back to the arcade inside. It was oddly full for the moment: seemed like there were dozens of kids running underfoot, all playing pinball, or tag, or whatever racing game was in the back room.

"Doing okay, Champ?" It was Twi doing the talking. He waved me over to the bar and I joined him for a root beer.

"This is a lot to handle," I said, looking at all the kids.

"We'll get used to it." Twi said, shrugging. "Or not."

"I just don't get why there's so many!"  

"We're excellent compartmentalizers," Twi responded with a wink. "Look how far we made it before we started making contact with each other. Remember how scared we were of failing? Of falling behind?"

"Yeah! It was stupid and I hated it. I'd be having lots of fun making a song or something and then you'd get afraid that I wasn't perfect enough."

Twi's brow furrowed. One of the kids - a ghost, for all intents and purposes - smacked him on the leg. "Tag!" He shouted, and then flew away. The other kids giggled. Me too, honestly. I would have given chase to the kid but Twi? Twi's all business when he's focused on something.

"I hope my past actions are water under the bridge.”

"Yeah!" I patted the top of his hand. "You got it, friendo. You were just trying to keep us safe, I know that now. But still, there's a lot of these kids. I don't know how we're gonna manage!"

"Would help to have a good babysitter for them all."

He forced eye contact with me and flashed a toothy smile.

“No.” I shook my head. “I’m not a babysitter. I'm a kid!"

"Yeah. A growing kid who is ready for more responsibility." He leaned in closer to whisper: "Listen, you know I'm bad with kids. Addie too. We could use someone like you. Someone who gets the kid experience."

"A teacher?"

Twi laughed. "Yeah. A teacher. But you have to teach by doing, okay? Learn how to make them feel safe with us."

"I could do that. Oh!" I forced the world to come back into focus. The arcade disappeared, replaced with my condo's comfy couch and a pile of presents. Twi and I were still *there,* in a matter of speaking, controlling the body like it was some sort of Voltron. 

Twi found himself holding a wrapped gift. “So surprise, I bought presents with D. This one's for you!"

Twi and I tried our best to control the body together. Usually it wasn’t a big deal, but sometimes what we want didn’t quite match up with what the body was doing and that's because we aren't on the same page inside. But this time, the little imp had no problem picking up the small package and tearing it open.

He almost dropped it in shock when he saw it: a simple paring knife from IKEA.

"I don't know if it's any good, but anything's better than us using that knife you tried to kill us with. It's not okay that you haven't replaced it yet."  

"I didn’t want to forget it,” Twi said. “We’ve done too much forgetting. It’s time to sit with who I really am—“

"We forgive you," I said, and felt a hundred voices nod in agreement inside. "You were doing the best you could. And besides, because of that scare you found us!"

"Thank you," Twi said. Then I felt a pat on my knee.

“I’ll leave you all to talk,” D said, and then I was back in the arcade, shaking hands with every little creature I could see.

## Misty, 2011, age 9

I met Uncle J once as an adult, even though I was still a kid on the inside. We were at a family reunion at a homestead separated from the world by a long, gravel road. I’d been invited by my stepmother as a sort of peace offering.

It was awkward, to say the least. I was a few months into hormone replacement therapy and very obviously Not Passing. Few people in the family bothered to talk to me, and I only ended up staying an hour or two before noping out.

But on the way out I saw Uncle J leaning on a wooden fence. He was watching kids play in the field. I hadn’t seen him since… gosh, since my dad broke his relationship with him a decade or so before. (Something involving extramarital sex, I think.) But there he was, a little greyer and a little more aloof, but he was still the uncle who saw me. The uncle who cared enough to help. The uncle who spoiled me like a princess.

And there, in the middle of nowhere, we met eyes. Or at least I tried to; he looked right past me.

I tried to make small talk. “Hey there, Uncle J. How’s life?”

He deigned to meet my eyes when I talked. “I don’t agree with it.”

Just like that.

“Okay, well I’m happy and I figured you’d like to know that.”

“Yeah. Got it.”

Have you ever felt like a discarded condom? Because there, in that moment, the one uncle who had been my rock simply didn’t perceive my existence. I felt small, limp, and full of gross juices in that moment.

I’ll never forget how low I felt in that moment, watching my favorite uncle in the world toss me aside like a little rubber sleeve that was no longer useful. But hey, that’s what being trans is like. People can get really shitty about it and they’re allowed to, and I have to turn the other cheek and let them abuse me.

Honestly, I was used to it.


## Potts, 2023, age 38

It didn't happen overnight - growing up, that is.

System age is hard to explain to singlets. It's like, uh, so imagine you're reading a book, right? And you're not sure what age the protagonist is because it never gets said out loud. So you listen to the context, you know? Decisions they make. Things they like. Values they hold dear. Things that you pick up real quick when an alter comes up and demands a stuffed animal, you know?

So how did I grow up? It happened piece by piece as I helped babysit those little kids. I worked with meditation to build them a comfortable, safe place inside the world.

In fact, let’s take a look at one of these little kiddos right now! This is Samantha. She presented as a ghost and had spent years in what she calls “the Dark Place” in our head. When she was found, I guided her to a large park outside the arcade by the smell of a campfire that never gets smoky and the sound of children playing in a giant treehouse.

Yes, there’s lots of them. No, it doesn’t bother me anymore. Used to; made us feel a little hopeless that we’d ever heal. But for now, the kids are just that - kids who need love and support to heal. 

Each new kid came covered in filth and Samantha was no different. She was covered in muck and mud and caked-on sweat when I got a hold of her, so first order of business was to pull out a wet rag. “Come on over here, kiddo,” I said in the gentlest voice I could. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”

I dabbed the sweat and grime from her brow with a gentle smile. “See? No strings attached here. I just want to help. The past is over now, kid. You’re so so safe now!”

Samantha shied away from my hand at first. “I did terrible things and I’m sorry I’m sorry–”

“Hey, hey! None of that.” I wrapped her up in my arms. “You’re safe now. You did really good, holding onto whatever you have! And now you get to play with all your newfriends in here.

“And if I want to do things in the real world?”

“We can make that happen too!” I shot finger-guns her way. “We have so many kid nights, girl. You’re gonna be happy here.”

Not mentioned to Samantha was the fact that I’d just climbed a three story ladder to break into my house because of her.

See, my wife and I went out for dinner without knowing that Samantha had locked all the doors in the house to feel a little safer. Needless to say it was a shock to come home to a house locked up in a way we weren’t used to, and having forgotten our keys I had to scramble up a ladder and shimmy into our third story condo window.

I’m sure we’ll laugh about it at some point in the future, but in that moment I was ever so slightly angry about it. Not that I was going to take that out on Samantha; she didn’t know any better. “I promise you’re okay, honey. Even if we had to shimmy through a window!”

“I’m a kid in a big body,” Samantha said. “I don’t fit in anymore.”

“Hey.” I took her by both shoulders until she met my eye. “You fit. You matter. More than anything in our world right now, even!”

“Really?”

“Honest honest.” I held out a pinky. “I’ll take a pinky swear on it. Anytime you want to be out in the body, we’re gonna find time for you to play. And we’ll buy you toys: legos, coloring books, dolls, whatever you want!”

“Misty said we didn’t have a lot of girly things.” Samantha said. “But it was a long time ago.”

“Yeah. Great news for you there.” I pushed away from her, did a twirl, and pointed to the arcade. “We live in Chicago now and we became a girl like, fifteen years ago. Being a girl is old news now.”

“You’re kidding!” She cracked a grin but paused before continuing. “But what about you, Potts? You’re a guy.”

“It’s complicated,” I said, shrugging. “But come on, let’s get you a good shower and a fresh look. Sound good?”

“Yeah!” A small shower stall with a locking door appeared from thin air, already hot and steamy and cozy for the little girl. While she busied herself with that I went about imagining a wardrobe full of magical clothing for her to try on.

We learned the tip from “Coping with Trauma-Related Dissociation.” It’s a mediation technique where you offer your little parts clothing that will, for example, render them invincible, or make them invisible, or even cause some people to never be able to talk to us. As they make picks, I take notes on what they chose and try to note places in our life where some change would make the kid more comfortable. Honestly, the stuff these kids ask for shocks me: pants that can’t come off, invisibility cloaks, sharp teeth to bite probing tongues.

I tried my best to not think about the details. Not now. Not yet. Make the kids feel safe, and ask hard questions later.

“Do you know any other kids back there?” I asked.

She shouted over the shower. “A few. They’ll come eventually.”

“Cool.”

While she took a bath I ran to the treehouse and told the others about Samantha. They all agreed to make her feel safe and comfortable inside and set about making a welcome party for her.

Again, this was all happening in my mind. It’s… well, it’s hard to explain to a singlet. The world inside my brain has state, with noticable landmarks and familiar cooridors I crossed in my dreams. The arcade was just the interface when we’re awake, and if we put our minds to it we could shape the world to our will.

Once upon a time, this space was bleak and inky-black with dark, black tar. It took months for us to build out a space for the kiddos outside, and that only came after a few sick days to recover from the resulting PTSD episodes.

When she came out she was wearing a cute bathing suit. That was one of the rules inside; no nudity, no matter what. Some of the kids even hated looking at our own body without clothes on.

I pointed to the wardrobe. “Take your pick.”

The wardrobe gave way to an entire clothing store in hyperspace, the likes of which still makes no sense to us. But she traipsed around the ailes, found some bunny ears and a pink dress, and emerged a tiny little white bunny with a screwdriver and a bunch of electronics.

Just like that, Samantha knew she was safe and I knew how to solder again.

It’s impossible to explain but our skills are split between different alters. We’re never sure when we’ll be able to do things we’ve spent years practicing. For example, we grew up learning how to code but forgot for about 20 years because the alter who learned went dormant. As they come back online, the skills come back to us.

And so it goes, one child after another, slowly being nudged toward the present in the gentlest, most loving way we could manage. Be the one who helps the kids for long enough, you grow up. Find all the kids, and eventually you can heal into a single personality. Simple as that, right?

Gods, I wish it were that simple. But we try, and we struggle, and sometimes we perservere. Best of all, every child we find brings back some wonder to our life. The kid who learned piano, for exmaple. Or the kid who knew how to draw decently. Or the kid who dances - we love the kid who dances for bringing that back to us!

Little by little, alter by alter, we will grow up through this. Anything short of that, and the abusers win.


## Sam(antha), 2023, 9 going on 39

All I ever wanted was to get the princess treatment.

I remembered this apartment complex from a long time ago. Where it is isn’t important. My sister and I would spend weekends there and hang out with our new stepsisters. They used to be close family friends but now they were part of the family, and that’s really rad.

But they also are all girls, so sometimes I didn’t get invited to play. Like when they played dolls, or watched girl shows, or did each others’ makeup. That’s when I had to keep myself busy, usually with videogames. But I wished like hell I could have been girly just like them!

I asked the system if I could go to the Ren Faire in mid-2022, and they all agreed. I felt… silly about it, really. The adults didn’t like the idea of a kid running around in our body in public. But I said I’d act like an adult, and with enough begging and pleading they let me take the day. So I put on the prettiest, whitest, frilliest dress we had, packed a bag of toys, and we drove to the Ren Faire to hang with friends.

On the drive there I shared the story of that apartment with D and they didn’t skip a beat in responding. “We can give you a Princess Day, Lucy. If that’s all that stood in your way before, that’s easy to fix!”

“Really!”

“I love when the system challenges are easy,” D said

Bristol Renaissance Faire was, at that time, the largest freestanding faire in the US. Worn dirt paths wove their way through rows of low-slung cottages, all selling time-appropriate clothing, crafts, and favors. There was even a legit joust at the end of every day, which was super exciting!

We met up with some friends in the faire. Before that I had laid eyes on a parasol and D just bought it for me like it was nothing! So I was smiling and spinning that little parasol like the princess I wanted to be while we greeted our friends.

“This is Samantha,” D explained. “She’s 9, and she gets to be spoiled today.”

My friends nodded in agreement, and from that point forward I was just a kid in their care.

Over the course of the day I purchased (and changed into) a completely new outfit. D bought me a circle of flowers for my head, a cute crop top, a wrap skirt, and some really pretty earrings and a necklace. I flounced, skipped, and bounded around the faire without a care in the world.

Because my friends - my family! - just loved me as I was. No anger at me acting weird. No mean words when I did something embarrassing. They gave their love freely, no strings attached, in a way i hadn’t experienced before. Kindness, affection, and genuine love overtook ancient fears, and for the first time in my life as an alter I got to enjoy myself.

Gosh, the things we did! Archery, for one, even though I couldn’t see. I got in a fight with the town quartermaster, meditated with the town healer, and bought a giant turkey leg. There were jugglers and comedians and it was all so much fun to do.

And then we got to watch a joust! Seriously, if you haven’t seen a joust before you should. They’re so cool! And the sound a wood lance makes when broken on armor is super cool.

It was after that joust, when we were walking back to the car, that D noticed it. “You’re not skipping anymore,” they noted.

“Guess I’m tired,” I replied. “It was a long day of walking, after all. This outfit sure is fun! I’m so glad you let me splurge here.”

“You’re still Samantha, right?”

“I think so, yeah.”

D’s leaned closer. “You sound older.”

“Huh.” I asked inside about my age. Everyone shrugged. “Ask me.”

“What?”

“How old I am. Ask me!”

“Okay, I’ll bite.”

“I am 38 fucking years old.” I said, smiling. “Finally, I caught up with the body.”

“Wow! That’s impressive.”

We drove in silence for a while. Not for lack of conversation, mind you; there was plenty to discuss after a day at the faire. Instead, I was busy talking inside.

“Happy birthday,” Addie said. Inside, we sat at a table near bar, where pint glasses on the bar rocked back and forth in time with the sway of the car. It was only her there this time; the others respected my wish to have the day to myself, and the only reason Addie hung around was to jump in if I fell out.

I sat down at Addie’s table, laughing. “I guess this does this count as a birthday, doesn’t it?”

I looked down at myself and saw my body. Not the form I usually took inside the head: a large, plus size rabbit-girl. Instead I was there, visibily human, and I wasn’t sure if I was a kid dreaming I was an adult, or an adult waking from a child’s dream.

“You did really good, Lucy, and now you get to grow up. Congratulations.”

I felt the pull of sadness on my heart. “Thanks. But, uh.”

“What?”

“She’s never coming back, is she?”

“Who?”

“You know. Mom.”

Addie shook her head. “I know you miss her. We all do. But what’s done is done. She didn’t like us being a girl.”

“That’s stupid.”

Addie pointed at me. “Little of that 9 year old poking out still.”

“Oh, yeah.” I sat with it for a moment. “I’m just sad.”

“I know.” Addie put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sad too. But with time, you’ll learn what happened between us. It’s not pretty.”

“I got that idea.”

Snap. We’re back in the car. I think… Right. D was talking.

“So? How does it feel to be old?”

“Comfortable,” I said with a smile. “Thank you, D, for babysitting me today.”

“Anytime,” D said, and then thankfully put on music so that I could go back inside and talk with the others about my miraculous transition to emotional adulthood.


## Sam, 2024, age 40

Right, uh, memoir stuff. Hi! The others asked me to contribute to this project so I wrote a this. I'm Samantha. And Misty, and Lucy, and a whole host of other girls who are sexual assault survivors that banded together to form a new alter. You may have seen me contributing to the memoir project in other parts of the narrative under different names. Turns out system shake-ups turn everything upside down.

That's what we call 'em, at least. System shakeups. We'll hit some life milestone, or process some deep trauma, and our internal world gets thrown into a tizzy. What comes out the other end is... still me, technically. Still "us," still a collection of alters. But our skills, our demeanor, our everything else? You might as well roll a fresh set of alters and toss out what you thought you knew.

You have to understand that there's around 400 distinct parts inside this brain at all times, swimming around in an amnesia soup because of things that were done to us as children. When we grow, parts of our selves move to other parts of ourselves, taking with them their memories and their skills. The resulting alters are pastiches and we have to figure out who can do what all over again.

I can't tell you how exhausting it is.  To not know what day it is, what time it is, what I was just doing two seconds ago. To find half-done tasks someone inside started but didn't finish. To excusing yourself from a party you're enjoying because some kid inside wants to hump the air and scream into a pillow. To being treated like a _literal fucking child_ because you are temporarily not able to make decisions for yourself.

So why wouldn't we try to pretend that things are better? Why would we want to be connected to who we really are inside, when that person is just a pile of miserable little alters? 

For now, I'm a bit more connected to the inside than I was before, and that's a good feeling. The more we come together, the fewer gaps in time we feel. The more we push our healing, the less our system symptoms get in the way.

But still, deep down in our heart of hearts, we know that our brain's totally broken beyond the point of repair. And it scares the fucking crap out of us to think about it.


## Max, 2023, age 18

...oh wow I type so differently now lol

I really thought hypergirly Samantha name was going to stick didn't I lol

## Addie, 2020

Our official plurality journey began with pizza during the pandemic.

COVID was at a lull in August of 2020, and restraints on gathering loosened for a brief summer window while cases were low. Importantly, _people could go out to eat_. After months of being cooped up in our Chicago condo we were desperate for any hint of normality, so we jumped on the chance to get pizza at our favorite Chicago tavern. 

It had been a hot summer, and we'd spent it swimming in the lake as well as doing a lot of work on ourselves. Gone were the long nights of drinking, replaced with a healthy diet and more early morning activities. I was in the best shape of my adult life after a half-year of working with a personal trainer. The suicidal ideation was gone, replaced with morning meditations, tea, and a deep feeling of being _centered_ that I had never felt before.

The area we lived in bristled with residential high-rises, mom and pop restaurants, and families living out their lives in middle-income housing. It was the sort of community that pulls you in deep and *forces* you to care; where your neighbors were the same people who served you at the pub, or the ones who ran the register at the small grocer nearby, or lived in your building. It was home, in a way that I had never experienced before.

Safe. _I was safe._

As we walked to the tavern my mind drifted back to memories of my transition. I had lost my job due to a layoff and had just enough money to pay for next month's rent. I had a religious experience in that moment: a guardian spirit assured me things would be okay and started taking over my body. She helped me find a new job, scrap to start my career, and navigate being estranged from my family.  

Yep. You heard that right. Guardian Angel. Her name was Tally, and she saved my life.

A chilly breeze blasted us with the smells of the lake as we moved between high-rises. So yes, when my dysphoria was at its worst and I was ready to give up and die I was, quite literally, possessed by the spirit to survive.

I cannot overstate this; I'd wanted to kill myself since I was about 13, and every single day I didn't attempt was a blessing. Having Tally believe in me, holding my hand through the toughest two years of my life, saved me. I would have died without her, easily.

Back in the real world the traffic light changed and we crossed the four-lane street. I squeezed D's hand and then, without meaning to, words started coming from my mouth:

"Remember the spirit I told you about?"

There it was, that "I'm no longer in control" feeling. Saying the words felt... Involuntary? Compelled? Puppeted? I didn’t want to talk but there I was, talking anyway. That happened to me a lot when I was young: words would just come out of my mouth before my brain thought through them, and then I’d get in trouble for it. I could never remember little outbursts, come to think of it. 

But this? This feeling of _watching_ as my body went through the motions? This was different.

My “lips moved without my will. “Yeah. Tally. The one that did transition for me."

"The fox spirit that took control of your body for a while?"

"Yeah. That one."

We had talked about this at some point. I had long since chalked it up to either a spiritual experience or a mental break. Either way, it was in the past. 

“I thought she was gone.”

My head felt fuzzy, disconnected. I wanted to wake up.

_This wasn't supposed to happen anymore._

I watched my body cross the street, turn to D, and flash them a bright smile. “Surprise, she’s still here!”

D leaned on my shoulder. After five years of marriage we still acted like newlyweds, all playful and affectionate and such. We'd been through a lot together; the death of their father, panic attacks, depression, layoffs, and we got through by being each other's cheerleader. Our first date was seeing "Silver Linings Playbook" and spending the walk home talking about our traumas and our mental illnesses, so we took mental health pretty seriously in this house.

“That’s neat,” they said.

I noticed, as they grabbed my arm, just how much stronger they had gotten in the past three months.mWe had spent that time working through their gender. They started low dose testosterone a few months ago and just... gosh. They _blossomed_. Between their transition and my work to recover from the attempt in 2019 we were closer than ever.

For a brief moment I could move my mouth. And in a panic, I tried to tell D I was not okay. But all that came out was her voice, her choices, her _will._

“I don’t know what this means,” I managed, and then I lost control again.

“Who knows?” They looked to the sky for a moment. "I wish I could thank her for keeping you safe back then."

Words just spilled out of me. "Well, you're in luck then."

Their eyes widened. "Really? I thought she went away in 2011."

"I did, yeah. But I like to check in from time to time."

D stopped to meet my eyes.

"Tally?"

"Speaking!"

This was about the point where my memory faded out. Like, I remembered walking two blocks, the pizza we ate, the cosmo Tally ordered. But the memory was all fuzzy. Imagine trying to watch a scrambled porn channel in a hotel room and trying to make sense of what you were seeing. It was sort of like that; I knew things happened, but they didn't happen to *me*.

Guess I have to pass this over to Tally to finish, then.

## Tally, 2020

To begin with, I’m surprised I didn't go on a date with D earlier.

I'd poked my nose in to check on Addie from time to time, and I'd spoken to D a few times in the past without them knowing. But the idea of going out for dinner and a drink just never occurred to me until Addie started to get off the sauce. She's a bit of an anxious worrywort and never liked interventions, so I never tried before.

Now, though? Addie was safe. It was okay for me to give her a gentle push.

We arrived at the tiny tavern to a hero’s welcome. Gino's North was our local haunt pre-pandemic. It was this little shotgun bar that sat 10 to 20 people, tops, and stayed alive on the strength of their grandmother’s pizza recipe. Old gays owned the place and decorated it with plenty of camp and charm; local artists' work dotted the walls, and a giant faux marble statue of a nude woman stood sentinel over the bar. This place was so important to us that we made a point during the pandemic to order delivery from them every week to help keep them alive when restaurants and offices were closed down. It was the sort of place you expect to see in a sitcom: everyone knows your name, your hobbies, and your favorite orders, and nobody gets mean with that information.

We settled into one of four round booths beside the bar. Plexiglass surrounded us on two sides, but that didn't bother me at all. It was just nice to be up in the front and, well, _existing_. I know that's odd to say but that's exactly how I felt. A few moments ago it was 2008, and now it’s 2020.

(This is a completely and totally normal human experience, right? Anybody?)

The bartender brought water over. We made small talk from behind our masks for a moment, and I pretended to be Addie, the “normal” one, so nobody would catch wise.

"I didn't realize you came back," D said in a hushed voice. They had this gobsmacked look in their eyes that just made them look cute as a button.

I guess it's not every day your spouse blinks and becomes a completely different person, but they sure were along for the ride.

"Well, sweetheart, I never went away. Just went quiet for a little while."

"You've never talked to me before, though."

I chuckled. "Okay, a _long_ while. But I'm here now! You wanted to thank me, right? Let's get drinks first. You know, I've never had a drink in my life and Austen says the drinks here are great!"

That was Addie's name back before system discovery. Austen. The body's name. Poor dear didn't realize we existed back then, even though she'd experienced actual freaking multiplicity in her past. Stubborn one, her. We collectively decided she had to change her name so that no one alter was so important that they got to use “our” name.

It’s weird, I know. But that’s how our brain works.

"Yeah... uh, right. Thank you! Let's do that.” We waved down the server. I ordered a cosmo. Not sure why; Addie never really liked them to start with. Maybe it was the rom-coms I watched while Addie and I shared a body at the start of our transition. The ladies in those films loved ordering cosmos, and I was a lady, so a cosmo it was.

I ran my finger over the rim of the glass and flashed a wicked smile. "You should know that Addie is watching over my shoulder and is just fit to be tied!"

"Thanks for keeping them alive," D said. We toasted and took a sip. Turns out, not a bad idea ordering that cosmo. Real tasty.

"It was nothing. Couldn't have them hurting the body we share, after all."

"What brings you back?"

I put down the drink. "They're ready to know about us."

That caught D by surprise. I folded my hands and waited for them to process.

"Us?"

"Yep. _Us_."

"You can't be serious."

"Things are going to get rocky," I said as I tapped my forehead. "Up here, that is. But I know they're gonna get through it as a team. Doubly so with someone like you at their side."

The air felt thick and time slowed to a crawl. We sat in that silence for what felt like forever.

"That's a lot to take in," D said.

"They have no idea what's coming," I said, "and they're going to need you."

"Of course! I love you. …uh, them.”

"We made the best choices," I grasped their hands. "Meeting you, marrying you, and loving you. It's all gonna be okay. Promise. May just be a while before we get there."

"Sure thing," D said. “But first, pizza.”

## Addie, 2020

The L train rumbled overhead. College kids chatted about partying as they passed us on the sidewalk. High rises surrounded us on all sides, as if the city was a gigantic cradle holding us in safety.

I came to as we walked home. It's... hard to explain with words. It feels like a flashbulb firing in your head, or like waking up from a light nap. I knew that we just had dinner and yet when I tried to recall details about the past hour the memories slipped out of my fingers.

D squeezed my hand. I felt tipsy, and then memories of cocktails flooded my brain. Gauging by their wide smile and silly stride they were solidly in the pocket too. 

"Tell Tally I said thanks," D said. "It was nice meeting her."

"Tally, huh? She hasn't been around in ages—"

That was the moment I felt her presence inside. Warm, calming, motherly in its own way. I swear to you, I could feel her hand on my shoulder, her breath on my neck. Images of calm forests and night skies flooded my brain. For the first time in a decade, Tally was back.

_Tally was back._

"Holy shit."

D and I rounded the street corner in silence. Inside, however, it was a joyous reunion. I imagined myself hugging Tally, her warmth enveloping my body. She smelled of lavender. She was... blonde, I think. Milky skin. Green eyes. Two giant fox ears on top of her head, and a tail that wrapped around me as we hugged.

D turned to me. "You okay?"

"I thought you were gone," I said. D shot me a look but the words weren’t meant for them.

I could hear Tally’s laughter in my head. "You don't have to talk to me out loud. You remember that much, right?"

I pursed my lips and, uh, pushed my voice inward. Sorry. There's no good way to describe that without seeming like you've got a screw loose, is there? I was talking to someone inside my head, and they were talking right back to me. Totally normal.

I thought, "Uh. Yeah. Right. It's been forever, hasn't it?"

Tally flashed an image of her stern face in my head. "You said you didn't need me anymore, so I left."

"Oh."

She crossed her arms. "Yeah. *Oh.*”

"Still with me, Austen?" The world snapped into too-sharp focus. D and I were walking into our condo's lobby. They had both of my hands in theirs and a worried look on their face.

"I think so."

"Looked like nobody was home for a second there."

"I'm... gosh. I can't believe I"m saying this, but I'm talking to Tally.”

“I know, hon.” they smiled. “Everything okay?"

"Better than okay," I said. "Everything is wonderful!"

"I'll leave you two to it, then."

The world fell out of focus again and I found myself with Tally. I swear to you, I wanted to break into tears right there and then. She was back! My friend, my protector, my other half... Finally, we were whole again!

I imagined holding her hands in mine as we danced to the music of angels.

"I'm so sorry, Tally.”

"I know." Her voice came in stronger this time: angelic, mysterious, a little breathy. “Just leave it to me. I can get us through this year but you have to let me in and trust me. It's sort of like puppetry—“

“Yes.” I interrupted her. “Whatever it is, yes. Anything for you. I would have died without you."

"_We_ would have died, Addie. But here you are, good job, amazing spouse, house. Not a bad way to run a railroad if you ask me."

For a moment I couldn't speak, couldn't move, couldn't take my eyes off her. I wanted this image burned into my memory, and if I didn’t focus hard enough the memory will slip away. And just... gosh. I missed this. Feeling her presence, knowing that someone else was in my head, watching out for me even in my darkest moments.

Tally pulled away from my grasp. "You're doing great. I just wanted to hang back long enough to say that to you. Spare me a thought every once in a while, eh?"

I rushed back into arms and buried my face in her shoulder. I felt her hug me back, her thoughts filling full of lavender, fresh spring dew, fireflies blinking in the dusk.

"I wish you wouldn't go."

“Addie—“

“_Please. Please, for the love of the gods and all that is good in this world, don't go._”

She pinched my cheek. "Oh, Addie, I’m not going anywhere. You're stuck with me! Besides, I don't think you'll ever be alone in here again."

"Come again?"

"Spoilers," she said. With a snap of her fingers I catapulted back into the real world. 

I came to with my body tucked into bed, but I felt Tally laying right there beside me, her hands stroking my hair until I went to sleep.


## Twi, 2020

This is going to sound strange, but it's a lot easier for me to spill my guts to random people on the internet than it is for me to confide in friends. Between that longstanding quirk and not knowing any plural people at the time, I threw a hail mary of an ask to every nerd I knew:

"Hey folks, I'm not doing well lately. Like, really not well. So I'm trying something I'm usually very bad at: asking for support.

"Without going into the nitty gritty (and a wall of text), I'm dealing with some pretty nasty dissociative disorder issues that flared up in the past month. Specifically, I've gone from having a single person in my head (completely normal, I think!) to having, uh, six people in my head, give or take, depending on the day.”

(I stopped mid-word while typing the message. Six? _Six?_ It was three this morning!)

“This is causing me problems like dissociative meltdowns (where I just sort of, uh, shut down for a minute or two), panic attacks, and amnesia when a head-mate decides to ‘switch’ in and take over the body. Overall, it's a good step toward healing, as those head-mates have memories and skills that I usually don't have access to, but it doesn't change the fact that this is some scary-ass shit.

"Some folks here already know what's going on, and they've been lovely in supporting me. But it's a lot. I'd love to say that I'm handling it like a champ but I'm not. I'm white-knuckling my way through my days and feeling pretty scared about what the future holds, given these issues. 

“I’m the kind of person who takes pride in having their shit together and having a good memory, two things that are definitely not happening when six different people are trying to be a complete, single person. (That it's starting to affect my job performance is definitely not helping matters either.)

"I know times are tough right now for everyone, mental health wise, but any kind words, love, or support you have to spare would be very much appreciated right now. I also feel better when I'm helping others, so if there's anything you need to unload, problems you need help solving, or issues I can help fix, please reach out. \<3

"...and please feel free to ask questions, here or in DMs. Talking about the specifics of it makes it feel less scary, oddly enough."

Our friends showed up for us and put us in touch with people in the plural community.

I know, I know, that shouldn't be shocking. Giving a shit is table stakes in a friendship, but there I was, feeling relief and overwhelming gratitude that the people in my life took the time to care for me.

You’d almost think I was worth loving, given how they all came through!

## Addie, 2020

We can’t ignore the elephant in the room: 2020 was a very, very important presidential year. As a trans woman in a lesbian marriage, I was terrified. Politics used to be fun, but this felt existential; that if something didn’t change, my way of life was going to be on the chopping block. The one thing I want most in this world is for the election to be over.

Waking up those days started with a long bout of news: Washington Post, The Bulwark, Twitter. Click all the links around election coverage. A half hour would pass and then I’d roll out of bed. We hadn't kept up on chores for a few weeks now; doing anything other than working and living was just impossible.

No clothes. I sniffed t-shirts from the hamper. "Four more days," I said. D stirred in their bed. "That's all we have to survive before election day. Then this whole mess will be over."

"Here's hoping,” D said. “By the way, you left a note to yourself last night.”

Taped to my computer monitor was a note card in someone else’s handwriting.

"Check your videos."

“I didn’t write this.”

D shrugged. “Well, one of you did." They busied themselves with getting dressed for their court call in what we called our “pandemic mullet”: tank top, lawyerly blazer, and pajama pants. I worked in IT project management but dressed mostly the same: professional on top, pajamas on bottom.

"I don't remember writing this."

“You do.”

Another voice in my head. I was getting used to hearing them by that point. Mostly it was Tally inside, yammering away, but sometimes I'd hear different voices. Some whispered. Others screamed. Some cried. But when I felt like I was losing my cool the voices would die down and Tally would be right there, ready to calm me.

D leaned back into the room as they threw on their blazer. "Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just... you know."

I tapped my temple, twirled my finger to sign "crazy", and rolled my eyes.

"I see," D said. "Well, make sure they make you eat breakfast." They disappeared downstairs to start their court call, and in the silence Tally hummed a little tune that I swear I could hear in the real world.

She clucked our tongue. “You don't have to be mean to me,” I… I mean Tally said. The mouth wasn’t mine to use in right now.

"What?" I thought.

“Like what you’re experiencing isn’t real.”

“It’s not that.”

“No. You want some logical rationalization so that you can convince yourself I’m not real. That way, you can dismiss me.”

“Where is this coming from?”

Tally did her best impersonation of my voice. “I’m crazy, and if I’m crazy no one will love me! But people do love me, which means I can’t possibly be crazy. Ergo, I can just ignore the voice _literally taking control of my body_ like it’s no big deal.

She grinned. “Did I get close?”

I wanted to tell her to fuck off but I still didn’t have control of my mouth. A quick look at the clock told me I was too late to make tea, or meditate, or any of the good live/laugh/love bullshit habits I’d been working on over the past few months.

So before I could get lost in the despair of being a legitimately crazy person, I put on a face and went to work.

On went the work laptop; I went about logging in and joining my first meeting of the day. When you do Agile project management your day is just meetings upon meetings, and today was supposed to be no different. Four hours of meetings in the morning, two in the afternoon, and four hours of paperwork to fill out before I could relax tonight.

I watched my team give project updates through Zoom. Then, without warning, their voices went fuzzy. I looked to the post-it note again and, without thinking, picked it up.

“You need to watch this video,” Tally said.

“I hate when you do that,” I said.

“Do what?”

“Control my arm like that. it feels creepy.”

She tutted. “You used to think it was a cool superpower.”

“That was before I had a job I had to focus on. This is a huge opportunity for me, you know? If I do this right I can become an Agile Coach full time!”

The meeting had gone quiet, but I was too busy arguing with a voice in my head to notice. 

“—Austen?”

The world snapped back into focus.

You ever have that dream where you’re taking a test and you can’t remember any of the answers? Well, I lived that dream every time this happened. Panic gripped my throat. I wanted to apologize, disconnect from the meeting, run, and hide under my covers, I was so scared.

“I’m sorry,” I said, flustered. I fought the instinct to run and hide. “Uh, I was multitasking. Come back to me in a minute?”

“Sure thing,” a coworker said, and then I smashed the mute button.

I placed the note back on the monitor bezel. “I told you I’d look at this later. Four more days, I promise.”

“When you're not a nervous wreck about the election?”

“Well, yeah. I’m too busy to have a breakdown right now, Tally. We both know that. Just let me push it down a little longer.”

For a moment there was quiet - blessed, beautiful quiet! Then her voice boomed in my ear: “Nope. you said that in 2008. Never again. I’m putting my foot down.”

My hands moved outside of my control. I shut down the work laptop. Turned off the monitor. Then, my hand reached for the phone and pulled up my photo library.

Inside were a half-dozen videos of myself that I had no memory of creating. Weirder still, none of those videos were made by *me* Sure, it was my body in the frame, and my mouth making the sounds, but something was off. One version of myself in the phone had a gentle voice, a feminine "pop" to their hips, and a warm smile that I swear to you, had you paid me a hundred dollars on the spot to replicate it, I couldn't. In another video we used a male voice that we hadn’t attempted in 12 years. Another one was my body, but it looked like it was shot by a five year old; their twinkling, bright eyes and a wide smile belied a playful, childish innocence.

Each video had the same message:

"You're doomscrolling again," the video said, and immediately I wanted to turn it off.

I didn’t remember doing this. Oh gosh, I don't remember this at all. It's me-but-not-me in the video and I'm talking to myself and this is how it ends, isn't it, when I finally crack and go crazy like I always knew would happen. After years of fighting off the insanity this was the straw that'd break everything and...

Wait, I _quit the meeting?_ Gods, I have to go back right now—

Tally’s soothing voice echoed in my ear. “Please, Stop doing that. Take a breath. Relax. I'm trying to help you, Addie. How does your chest feel?”

My shoulders relaxed. I put one hand to my heart as the other pressed the pause button on the video. My breaths were shallow and fast; my heart pounded loudly enough to drown out the background noise around me.

“You're having a panic attack, friend. Remember what your therapist says? ‘Ride the wave.’ You're going to be fine.”

I breathed until I didn’t feel dizzy anymore and restarted the videos.

The not-mes smiled and flashed warm, empathetic, confident eyes in the videos. It was almost like they were, well, _concerned_. Which didn’t make sense; who in the hell shoots a video of themselves to stage an intervention—

…oh no.

Another voice: this one husky, feminine, but familiar. I’d used it for a few months in 2016 when I had a hard butch phase. “The election will happen no matter how you end up feeling about it. Also hello, this is what it looks like when Max fronts."

I felt terror well up in my heart. why was I doing this? Surely it was an act. All I had to do was assert my will hard enough. Tell the voices in my head to buzz off. Concentrate really hard on bottling up the feelings welling up in me: terror, anger, frustration, grief, the whole lot.

“What is all this?” I hissed. I wanted to delete it all and throw the phone away, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

“I’d like to wake up now,” I said, but the words wouldn’t leave my lips.

Tally rooted through my phone. She went on a application deleting spree: Twitter, Facebook, my news aggregators. Anything I could use to obsess about the election, Tally nuked it from the phone.

"You need to take a break," she said, using my mouth to say it. "For all our sakes, you need to give us some control. The more you fight, the worse this will get."

I felt terrified, powerless, and humbled, all in equal measure. So I gave up fighting as the body went about de-politicizing my life.

“You’re going on a social media diet. No more doomscrolling. No more dancing around the facts of your brain. There’s a lot of us in here, and you’re going to learn to deal with that.”

“I have a therapist.” I said. For a moment I looked back to the work laptop and willed myself, with every fiber of my being, to jump back on the work call. I might as well have tried to move the Earth itself.

"You need to tell him about us. Today. Either do it at your pace, or I'll get it done for you right now.”

She pulled up my therapist’s number.

“Your choice.”

Then: vertigo, disorientation, the fulttering of eyelashes and the panic of possibly passing out.

I woke up. Again.

My hands were back under my own control. I turned them around to inspect them closely, making sure I wasn't dreaming. My mind felt clean - too clean, as if I had forgotten something very important that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

“Glad to see you getting the point,” Tally said. “Now take the day off. we’re getting you an emergency session.”

## Joey (or one of us)?
\<Something here about that emergency sesion.
“I have not done this before. But we’re gonna get through it.”

## Addie 2020

I didn’t just rely on a therapist.

My entire life, up to that point, had been shaped by the kindness of internet strangers. I learned to write by way of a Tennessee autoworker who published science fiction. I cut my teeth writing for strangers on the internet, taking and giving praise for the stories we wrote together. Even now, 30 years later, I still keep in contact with many of the folks I met there, and when times get tough I still look to them for support.

The plural community, as it turns out, was no different.

The Great Cats System was one of the first systems to help us figure out being plural, and honestly their collective help saved our life. We spent days chatting with them over Telegram and for the longest time I only knew their face by the ever-changing, furry avatar picture that represented who I was talking to. But the intensity of their attention, the obvious love and empathy they put into every person they helped, and the way their experience of DID matched up with the way we experienced it kept me coming back every minute of every day, hanging onto any advice they could give me.

They were the first system I really got to know in detail, and let me tell you the experience of beeing seen like that was liquid lightning in my veins. In those early conversations my memory felt like swiss cheese, and scrolling back through the timeline would leave me scratching my head as to who wrote our responses. She assured us that all was well, and that this was part of the process.

It didn't take her long to prescribe a fix for my problems: "You need to take a vacation, Addie."

"I don't have PTO," I replied.

"No. _You_, Addie. You need to take some time away from the front."

I'd made a study of all the lingo: switching, co-consciousness, littles, trauma holders, protectors, persecutors... not that I knew how to identify them inside my own head, that is, but I tried anyway. Inside was always radio silence.

"You need to let someone else front. The election is driving you up a wall."

"I don't know how."

"Ask inside. _Nicely_ ask inside, I mean. Open yourself up to them."

"Okay."

"Tell them you want to switch out," she texted, but before I could respond the world fell out of focus again.


---- 


I came to months later.

D and I were seated at a local brunch place's patio, champagne flutes in our hands. People shouted and cheered from their balconies. Every passing car honked their horn. Some even unfurled an American flag and blasted Bon Jovi over their car stereos. The owner of the joint walked around and clinked glasses with every patron.

D must have noticed me spacing out and took my free hand into theirs. "Hi! Who's this?"

“It’s Addie. Why am I out here?"

"It's November 7," D said. "The election was called. Biden won. We're gonna finish brunch and go to Boystown. Remember?"

"No?"

"It's fine. Tally said that might happen.” D raised their glass to me. “To this whole mess being over.”

“To new beginnings,” I replied, and we clinked glasses.

## Tally, 2020

Addie sat cross-legged on the beige carpet of our guest bedroom, breathing slowly, deliberately. The real world melted and she found herself staring at a barren expanse, darkness as far as the eye could see.

"So now what, Tally? This seems so silly."

"Hush! It's visualization. We need a way to talk to each other inside."

"I can hear you just fine."

"We need _something_. Like... like a talisman, you know? Something to help us conceive of _us_ Something comfortable. Something safe."

"The arcade."

My ears perked. "Okay, you have my attention. Go on."

"Well, I remember loving the arcade growing up. There was this one near us called Putt Putt. The one on Washington Street? Our uncle took us there on Saturdays for golf and go-karting. And when we were in that space, no matter who was with us, nothing bad happened to us, right?"

I smiled at her. “Because lots of kids plus lots of adults means lots of witnesses..."

"Exactly."

I put a finger to my chin and considered talking more about the uncle. No. Not yet.

“Love the energy, Addie. But let’s pick something more recent, maybe?”

“Okay.” She snapped her fingers. “Logan Arcade. We've been there, what, twice a month for the past five years to play in that pinball league? I bet we could remember every twist of that place if we needed to."

I raised my hands and well-worn wood flooring rose up to meet us. Above, pressed tin ceiling tiles fell into place with an audible clack. Brick rose from the void to define the walls. Small lights twinkled in the ceiling, and from the floor dozens of pinball machines rose into existence. Jake Shears played over the sound system and for a moment the stress and trauma that formed the background noise of our collective life gave way to simple, straightforward bliss.

I prodded Addie further. “Okay. What do we _need_ out of this place? Far as I'm concerned, we need a way to know who is driving the body, some places to represent being not in front, and a place to help everyone sleep. Thoughts?"

"Well, there's these double doors in the back we can use for the front. Throw up a control panel there - something with multiple joysticks and buttons and stuff—“

"—Inside Out style!"

The fronting room came into focus. To the rear, a double-door exit opened to an alley slick with rain. Across the street there was a drive-in projector screen that showed what the body's eyes saw. On one wall, we placed a low-slung leather sectional with a good view of the same screen. Pinball machines lined the other wall. Through an archway was a dark room lined with old coin-ops, and past that a dark, homey bar was bracketed by more pinball machines, an antique coke machine, and Chicago windows that looked out on a rain-slick city street.

“You can’t go back from this,” I told her.

“From what?”

“This is like hanging a giant ‘OPEN’ sign inside your head. I don’t know who will come, or how many there will be. Just… Look.” I pinched my brow.

“Something may go wrong.”

“Can’t be wrong,” Addie replied. She put a hand to my cheek. “I’m here with you.”

“Softie.” Laughing, I nudged Addie toward a cord attached to a large "OPEN" sign that sat in the window. "Want to do the honors?"

"Sure." Their finger touched the cord and then froze. They looked back. Swallowed a lump in their throat.

Addie flicked on the light. Cool blue and firey red neon shot out through the darkness. There was silence for a moment, but then a strong breeze threw open the door. Dozens of shadows - nothing more than eyes and soot and dust bunnies! - flooded into the arcade!

“There’s so many!”

“Yes!” I said. “We’re open for business!”

The sound of dozens of coin-ops and pinball machines spinning up buffeted us in a sweet symphony of chiptunes, chimes, and home.

## Addie, 2020

I typed my first post into the system chat: “Okay."

Someone in my head set up a system communication channel for us on the suggestion of some folks I followed on Twitter. I found it on my computer the day after the election call, and something inside me compelled me to click and write something. "Okay" was the best I could do.

My fingers started typing. A bot on the server proxied my message with custom avatars representing my alters. Tally’s avatar on the chat was a little cartoon fox we had picked off the internet.

I used a selfie.

Tally typed: “Okay? Just okay?"

"You win. This is real. There's more than one of us."

I expected anxiety. Fear, shock, something to prove to me that I had finally lost the last of my marbles. Instead, I felt a sense of calm. My shoulders relaxed and for the first time in a long, long while I felt like myself. Comfrotable. _Whole._

"What happens now?"

My fingers danced across the keyboard. "We get to know our neighbors. Hang out at the arcade. Ask questions. Be curious.”

“That sounds crazy.”
  
“That’s because we are,” Tally typed back, ending the message with a \<3 for extra sass.

## Addie, 2020

I was still waiting for a call from my family.

It had been a month since my first phone call with my sister and the silence was killing me. What surprised me was how desperately I wanted to see this man pay. Like, river-of-fire hatred of the man. It felt out of place, given the circumstances. Shouldn’t a good child support the family through this rough time? Offer solace and a neutral shoulder to lean on whenever it’s needed?

Instead, the fire raged on and on. All I could do was focus on putting out the brightest flames.

“You know what they’re going to say,” D warned us.

“But maybe this time will be different,” Lucy said, and I imagined her holding up the football to yank away again. “The stakes are higher now.”

I picked up the phone and rang my sister. She answered quickly.

“How the hell are you?”

“On tetherhooks. You told me last month dad was facing some serious trouble. What came of it?”

“Oh, your niece was just complaining about him,” she said.

I knew that lawyers had been called, and that the whole trouble started from a therapist’s mandatory report, but I still couldn’t find the stomach to contradict my sister.

“She made it all up.”

“Wait, everything blew over? He was accused of molesting a kid! He’s got a proven track record of assaulting women! How in the world does that all blow over?”

“She just doesn’t come around anymore,” she said. “When the family gets together, she stays home.”

The casual tone of her voice filled me with rage, and we bubbled over.

“I’m sorry, but this is in direct contradiction to what you said a month ago. You were on board with him getting his due karma. Now you’re suddenly parroting everything he says.”

“I never said that.”

“You did. I took notes.”

I could hear the surprise in her voice. “That’s weird. That’s why you don’t get to be with the family anymore.”

That’s the thing that drives me bonkers about my sister; no matter how sincere she sounds on one day, you could never expect what she’d say next. Usually it was parroting whatever line she heard last, far as I could tell, and the last person who got to her was my father.

“You still hate us for not being perfect about your transition.”

“That’s not true.”

“But it is. You refuse to come over. You hate us.“

“You’ve never once visited me in Chicago,” I replied, but that wasn’t going to be enough.

“I just wish you’d come around and stop being angry. It’s a shame that my kids won’t know their aunt because of misunderstandings like this.”

There was no reason to continue this conversation. Dad had gotten to her, and everyone was going to parrot the same answer.

“Why do you hate us so much?”

I wanted to lay it all out for her. To explain just how much being rejected for being trans hurt. About learning that being present was dangerous before the age of three. That all of the insults and anger over the years had ground me down to a smooth, round ball of a person who couldn’t get any emotional connection to the folks that hurt us. For the kid who wanted exactly one thing in the entire world - to be a girl - but couldn’t admit it for fear of being caught and sent to a straight camp.

But instead, all I could muster was resignation. “I… Sure. Yeah.”

“Can we put this behind us?”

“Sure,” I said, and promptly changed the subject to something small and Midwestern to end the meat of the conversation.

“How’d it go?” D asked.

“I don’t know why I bothered,” I replied.


## Lilith, 2024

Why would we write such an ugly book, you may ask? Because I need you to see this. To hear this. To know I am seen, and believed, and loved despite of all of it. I want you to feel what it’s like to be that little kid, barely out of diapers, who could not speak and had already learned that being present in the world was something to be feared. I want her - all of the little girls and boys in the system! - to know that they are loved, heard, and believed.

That is the most important thing I know on Earth, and all I need to know.

## Max, 1994
You ever wondered what time travel would be like? I don’t because I have been there and I have done that and I can tell you, it wasn't worth it.

So picture this. It was 1994. I was in the basement of my mom's house with a dingy old MS-DOS machine. It was a rainy mid-afternoon outside, and I could hear fat drops pattering on the half-window near the ceiling. The basement was a playroom of sorts: air hockey tables, dolls, nerf guns, costumes for dressing up and making plays and such.

But for me, the ocean-blue glow of the QBASIC screen was all the toy I needed. At the time I was working on an ASCII movie, I think, where I animated little text symbols to tell a story.

Upstairs, the yelling started. It was my mom yelling at my stepsisters. Again. I tried to block out the words - easier to have plausible deniability later if I was too busy to pay attention to the argument - but the shrill tone echoed through the kitchen, off the pantry, down the stairs, and then to my ears.

"You're worthless! How *dare* you treat your father like this?"

There was silence on the other end. There was always silence on the other end. It was always mom, screaming at two kids who couldn't muster a reply. I tried typing faster, harder, begging the buckling springs to drown out the sound, but mom was too loud, too piercing.

"I don't want you ungrateful kids in my home!"

I focused on the wall. Mom had a thing about splatter paint. Really any sort of craft with paint was her home turf. The walls of the basement had this coat of white paint with splatters of black and light charcoal that swirled, struck, and slashed their way behind the computer desk. I traced some of the lines and tried to go away, somewhere, anywhere but here—

"Aww, are you gonna cry and call your Mommy now so you can bitch and moan about how evil I am?"

I didn't go upstairs. I never went upstairs. She'd yell at me the same way if I did. Instead my fingers traced the paint on the cinder-block walls: little whorls, long swipes, thin rails where I could imagine my finger was a tiny railcar riding and jumping across an endless series of tracks, far far away from the noise. There, warmed by the blue glow of code and the splatter-paint railroad tracks, I could lose myself in absurd logic and daydreams while the screaming went on and on.

## Addie, 2003

So if I’m being honest, I’m not entirely sure where I fit into the system.

I know I’ve been around since 2003 in one form or another. Maybe I was around before then, maybe I wasn’t. But when it comes to memories, the earliest one I can remember clearly is from November 2003: meeting my new best friend, Dustin Friend.

We met in my freshman year of college at a furry meetup at Purdue. It was our first time going out to meet other furs in person. I knew one, maybe two of the folks at this thing, and only in that sort of friends-of-friends way that made introductions awkward. But this was my big chance to make friends - isn’t that what you do in college? - and I wanted to come out of the gate swinging wide.

At the time the system was, uh, let’s just say very confused about things. Misty spent the first six months of school trying to express herself as a girl, and in the process got us into a bit of hot water at our all-male college. Leaving home left us exhausted, as decompressing from all the trauma we experienced was taking its toll.

The meetup took place in a student apartment belonging to a friend from the UAE who wooed us with Smash Brothers and obscure flavors of kit-kats from his home country. His girlfriend also wowed the system with lots of nerd trivia and an adorable cat. While I can’t tell you the names of all the people I met at that little party, the only thing I can remember for sure was my friend, Dustin Friend, playing endless rounds of Smash with me, as if the world around us faded into nothingness. We clicked together like jigsaw pieces, and as the night went on our conversation grew deeper and deeper. We left that party with plans to hang out as soon as humanly possible, even if it meant a 3 hour drive to his place in Northern Indiana to make it happen.

And the best part? Dustin was safe. Before we discovered our system that seemed like a given, but gosh. Twi knew any single slip-up at college could come back to haunt us: tell an acquaintance from the same hometown a little too much in passing and it’d make its way back through the small-town gossip tree to our parents. But Dustin? Dustin was from an entirely different part of the state! Nothing we confided in him had a chance of getting back to my parents.

I can’t overstate just how powerful that realization was for us.

It wouldn’t have happened with anyone else in the system. Potts would have kept his distance. Twi would have thought something was wrong. Sam… well, she might have slept with him that night. It had to be me, the boisterous and outgoing asexual alter, taking point that day.

Dustin and I got together at least once a month after that. With time and a lot of bravery I found my queer little tribe on campus and blossomed into a weekday socialite. Then, on the weekends, I’d finish class, hop in my bedraggled, blue Pontiac Sunbird, and drive the three hours to Rochester, IN for a weekend with Dustin.

Every weekend together, we played games. A lot of games.

I obsessed about pinball, he obsessed about Pac-Man. But we both loved to play Dance Dance Revolution, and the closest machine to him was Tokens-n-Tickets. So most weekends we’d squeeze in a few hours to travel to the arcade and get our game on.

We’d spend hours pumping quarters into their DDR machine. I swear, by the time he moved away from that town I had memorized every machine in that place by heart: Ikaruga near the back, Keyboardmania on the right as you walked inside, a pristine Captain Fantastic pin opened up to show its innards stored behind glass near the entrance. Upstairs, there was pizza, though we never bothered to eat there. (That was time we could have spent gaming, after all!)

Six hours round trip - seven, if you counted travel time to the arcade! - to hang with this dude. And we’d do this dance at least once a month. So when we say this guy knows us, he *really, really knows us.*

## Max, 1996

Blink.

It was 1996 and I was back at mom's house. The home was a lot quieter now. No yelling. Lots more laughter. Parties on the weekend, too. Real alcohol-fueled ragers. I was sitting on one end of an extremely-90s upholstered sectional, and mom sat on the other. She popped a beer in the silence that filled the room.

"They were just troublemakers," she says. "Aren't you glad they're gone?"

My words come out robotic. "Yes mom. they were just the worst."

I miss them. To this day, I miss them both. But I smiled and I said what I knew needed to be said because that's how you don't get abused at home.

## Addie, 2024

Sam slammed her beer glass down and stared at me with icy brown eyes.

“No, okay, seriously. who the fuck cares? You met a friend in college. So did every single other kid that ever set foot in a dorm. What’s next, telling everyone about how hard you studied for finals, or how he both got so drunk at a convention one night that he fell asleep under the hotel bathroom sink?”

I hook my head. “He’s not just anyone, honey. He was the best man at our wedding! And like I said before–”

“–You get to write your part your way, sure. But it’s not interesting. It’s not helpful. It’s not... I don’t know. Not proof that we’re a system, or some wild switching experience, or anything like that. I don’t care about this story and I live inside your head. Why should anyone care?”

“Look, I’m getting to it. honest. Twi’s not the only part in the system that knows how to write. Just trust me, okay?”

“This is why we stopped writing.” She scoffed and ordered another champagne, and I went back to the draft.

Back in Rochester, Indiana, we were going to bed in his little bedroom. I laid on a foam chair that unfolded out to a flat cushion he lovingly called the flippy-fuck. We should have been sleeping, but we were too excited;.so we stared at the ceiling and talked about nothing at all for hours.

It didn’t matter the subject; I just loved talking about… well, whatever we wanted, really. Games, life, love, our initial foray into meeting furries in the real world, and figuring out our queerness. There were no boundaries on our conversations, and no matter how weird I got, or how outside of the bounds of “normal” I was, he was there for me. Listening. Laughing with me, not at me.

A friend like this, for me, had never happened before. In spurts, maybe. I had a friend or few in high school who reached that level of trust. But they were never fully safe, you know? In a small town word travels fast, and I was far enough outside the norm, as a closeted, queer trans woman in a literal Klantown, that any tidbit of information would be premium gossip back home.
 
“I don’t know who I am,” I admitted to him. “Maybe I’m a boy, maybe I’m androgynous. Maybe I’m gay, maybe I’m straight. I just… I don’t know.”

I stared at the ceiling, dumbstruck at the words coming from my lips. I had never said the words out loud before. Sam? Sure. She was out loud and proud as an androgynous bi person on chat servers online, secure in her anonymity and the physical distance from any harm that information sharing could have.

But at that point, Dustin knew our friends both at college and back home. We’d hosted him many times for holidays and long weekends at my mom’s house. This all could have gone so badly if he slipped up and said he knew too much.

The world is a dangerous place when you grew up in a small-town gossip mill. Word (and consequences) travel fast there. But Dustin? I knew deep in my heart Dustin was safe. That he’d keep my secrets, and he’d love me even if I did change.

Dustin rolled over to meet my eyes. “You’d still be my friend.”

“It just terrifies me.”

“I know how you feel.”

“But you’d still like me?”

“You’re awesome,” he assured me. I believed him. The memory grew hazy for a moment. We were sleep-deprived, exhausted from too much DDR, and living a moment where everything was just perfect. No anger, no yelling, no fighting; just two people being vulnerable around each other, nothing to see here.

“Is that the sun?” he asked, pointing to the window. “Oh shit.”

“We just talked all night, didn’t we?”

We laughed as the grey dawn touched our face, and in that moment I knew this guy was going to be my best friend for life.

## Max, 2000

Blink.

It was the year 2000. I was in a different house this time - dad's, I think. After the divorce he had refinished a dingy pole barn into a home for us. I was alone in a bedroom that must have belonged to me, given all the books and gaming consoles and such. I was resting my elbows on sculpted carpet that left deep patterns on my arms when I lay there for a long time.

In front of me was an old CRT monitor and an open mid-size tower PC. There were burn marks on some of the parts because dad had bought things cheap at a fire sale. Said if I could build a computer from the mess, he'd let me do whatever I wanted with it. I remembered staring at black-and-grey command prompt screens for hours at a time, typing in DISKPART commands and crossing my fingers that this time would be the time Windows 98 finally decided to install.

I’d been at it for months by this point, but the reward was too sweet to give up on: a honest, genuine private space in this home. Even if it was virtual, I’d have a line to the outside while—

*Crash!*

Upstairs I heard yelling, dishes shattering, people wrestling for control. There was always noises like that from the upstairs living room, and the voices reverberated through the house thanks to the living room's vaulted, primer-coat-on-drywall, pole barn ceiling. I knew Potts and Twi grew up here, but this space wasn't my home. 

I started typing commands into the computer, working quickly as I could. I didn’t like staying here. Things got dangerous here.

I know it sounds rude in retrospect, but there were different "masks" I wore depending on which home I was in. For mom, I put on a jester's cap and acted as silly as I could, knowing that would get her praise. At Dad's, Twi and Potts had to make themselves as small a target as possible to avoid their ire. And these weren’t just fanciful moods, either; each mask had their own backstory, their own knowledge, their own _skills_, so that there could be no cross-pollination between the two homes.

Me being here wasn’t just uncomfortable; it was dangerous. If my stepmom got a hold of me and started screaming, I’d start crying, and that just makes things worse. So I redoubled my efforts on the PC, hoping I could fix Twi’s problem and go back inside my head.

These weren't my kind yelling people. When I heard yelling it meant people were too drunk at 2AM, but if I stepped back from the computer for a moment I could identify the voices and the emotions: dad, my stepmom, my stepbrothers, my sister. A fight had broken out. Something about dad putting his foot down and trying to lay down ground rules set one of my stepbrothers off. Maybe this was about a girlfriend, maybe it was some drama with their dad, maybe they were yelling about report cards or smoking at school, whatever. It wasn't something I wanted to know about in any case.

The computer. _The computer is all that matters_.

I was already a writer by this point, apparently. Twi had a secret folder on the family computer where he’d write out his fanfics. We had made contact with a few writing mentors who were helping us find our feet in longer form writing. Getting this computer set up would let us write longer, more intense things.

I don’t know why, but Twi gets a rush whenever we do this writing thing. Something about it gets him to let his hair down, you know? It’s apparently good - we’ve published a few pieces and been nominated for some awards - but he couldn’t do longer stuff like novels until we had a computer of our own to draft on.

_To feel safe on,_ he corrected me.

I was hungry, but there was a strong feeling inside of my body like I shouldn't eat, shouldn't drink. *We have to make weight for tomorrow's dual meet.* The voice wasn't coming from me but it was *of* me, if that makes sense. Hell, I don’t even know how to wrestle, but apparently someone in here is pretty good at it.

I promised the voice I wouldn’t snack. It felt relief.

I entered a command and watched progress bars for a while. I loved progress bars. You could just zone out and stare at them and the world went by a lot faster. I liked when things went fast. Fast meant you got to sleep sooner, that the house got quieter sooner.

Just a bit more work, I thought to myself. One or two more restarts. We could fix this. Just needed a few more tweaks to the PC and there we could have privacy.

My stepmom screamed for Twi with the Angry Voice and he knew better than to make her wait. My body jumped to its feet and sprinted to the closed bedroom door. The world blurred. The memory was no longer mine but I got the highlights.

I sat in a dark-stained, cherry wood chair. Above, an ornate cuckoo clock ticked away on the wall. There was an aquarium bubbling away in a corner of the room, and the sound to this day could put ice into my veins.

## Sam 2024

I put my champagne flute down and applauded.

“Okay, Addie. Fine. You’ve convinced me that Dustin is a cool dude. What next?”

“I don’t know.”

My head tilted. I blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Like, I know what happens next. And I do remember going to tons of cons with him, spending a summer together, meeting all sorts of new folks, and getting too drunk at too many crazy room parties with him to count. But then? Once we started to know and trust people? the memories get–”

“–Hazy.” I tilted my head in confusion. The words came from my mouth, but they weren’t mine.

Hazy. _Unreal_.

I lived in a dream through most of college. Then, after graduation, Dustin and I moved to Indianapolis. He and I lived in the same apartment complex and were attached at the hip. If I wasn’t at work, and if I wasn’t busy trying to make my relationship with my family work, I was over at his place playing games.

He - and Mike, and Steve, and all the other friends we had at that time - they were our rock. Stuff got weird and hazy around that time, but they supported us, and we supported them. When my local group imploded he invited me into his circle of local friends with open arms. Better - he shouted our praise to the rooftops when given the chance. I swear, best wingman ever.

The new friends didn’t see me as a burden to shoulder. No - I was amazing to them, just as every single one of them were to me. For the first time a friend group ceased being casual friends and become a family.

...oh gosh. A family. My family.

We were back in our arcade again. I expected Addie to flash me this shit-eating, joker-style grin, the kind of smile that followed a horrible pun. But instead, they reached across the table for my hands.

I... I hadn’t really taken the time to look at them before. I mean, really look at them, inside the arcade. Here they were sporting a bright pink undercut, silly glasses, and a Hawaiian shirt so loud that it could have been cited for a noise violation. They were short and lanky, with bright eyes, toned build, and the bright smile of a performer. Her mood was a coin-toss between “all business, all the time” and “let me put on a show that’ll wow everyone around us.” A class clown and an orator, both too gay to function and too queer to move out of your way, she held space in a way few of us could match.

But here, the way Addie pierced us with her sincere eyes? This was new.

“I figured out why I’m here,” Addie said to me. “Just now. And I wanted you out front so I knew you would hear it.”

I could feel my heart skipping beats, the body’s shoulders pulled taught with tension. She considered her words for a moment before giving my hands another squeeze.

“College is hazy for all of us, I think. There were a lot of us running around the headspace then, trying to keep things going. We all knew that if we screwed up, well, that was going to be that. No net.”

“We escape our family, or we die trying. There was never a middle ground.”

“Exactly. So we all did what needed to be done to get out, get safe. And that meant pushing down what we wanted to get what we needed.

“We were so used to having to watch every little thing we did, but with the furries, in those moments, with Dustin and the crew? we didn’t need that. And I think to some extent we didn’t want that baggage to bleed over when we made our first impressions. I could be new, different, better, if I just let the past be in the past. And, well.”

Addie gave my hands another squeeze. “If I didn’t let people find you, they couldn’t hurt you. And I’m so, so sorry that I pushed you down for all those years.”

“You did all of this to keep me safe?”

Addie looked to the ground. “Yup.”

“You found out the system existed and then locked me away for a decade.”

“To protect you, yes.”

“Some protection.”

“I never said it was a good explanation. You trust people. You let them into your heart, and when they get there they can start seeing the scars. I couldn’t let that happen.”

“Everyone has scars.”

“Not us!” They slapped the table. "Not to anyone on the outside! That’s how it starts, you know? You let someone see your flaws, that gives them a peek at your weaknesses. Then, they start prying at the edges. Little needling at first, testing the waters. But then the needling becomes berating, berating abuse, and then we’re right back to where we started.

“We - all of us - are here to protect you. And yeah, I went a bit overboard. But if it meant you wouldn’t get hurt, I’d pay the price gladly.”

I leaned close and hissed a whisper. “How many years do you think we lost like this? Wound up like an electrified solenoid, ready to pop at the slightest pressure? How many good times do you think we missed, how many good people we never grew close to?

“How much living did we _not_ do because of our past? I don’t want to think about it. But I want to be different now.”

## Max, 1996


Blink.

It was 1996 and I was in an arcade in some remote Indianapolis warehouse district. I was — ugh, I was wearing the *boy clothes* in this memory. Gods. Baggy cargo shorts and a graphic t-shirt. You'd have thought I was trying to disappear from the world when puberty hit. But whatever, yeah. As long as I didn’t think about the clothes it was an arcade. Nobody could have a bad time in an arcade!

So I imagined something new to wear in the memoryand that made me feel better: pleated skirt and graphic tank top. Much better. I could do that with my memories, whenever I wanted. Something didn’t fit? Just imagine it away.

So we were at a place called Block Party, which was Blockbuster’s failed attempt at getting in on the mid-90s arcade boom. We were there with, well, what _will_ be family, eventually.  My stepbrothers were there, reserved, and trying their best to pull off the "whatever" teen look to seem cool. Me, I had got too many kids inside my head to show up at an arcade and _not_ act like a caffeinated four-year-old with a free play card in the arcade?

Come to think of it, my uncle was there. He loved arcades. He worked as a social worker or something and he knew the nice lady who helped me with vision stuff at school. I hadn’t seen him for many years because dad did something in the 90s that made them not like each other. (Something about sex probably.) But he was _here_, and he was paying a lot of attention to me and the other boys. It was nice to get his attention again.

I remembered being close to him growing up. Lots of overnights at his really cool house, which was full of games to play and things to do. He was also very nice to me, I think. But here he was kind of… standoffish, for some reason? Whatever. I was at an arcade and I got to play video games. That’s all I needed.

We waited at the bar for game cards while sitting on benches that looked like pinball flippers. Beyond the linoleum-lined pub was a large, carpeted ocean of arcade machines and pins, all there ready to be explored.

I was _vibrating_ with energy.

I was scared of my stepbrothers, I think. They hit me and said mean things to me and made me feel like I wasn’t good enough boy for their time. So when time came to go out and have fun I split off, hoping to enjoy the games by myself.

Here and now, where everyone was on their very best behavior, things were nice. There were lots of people there so nobody could yell at us. And it was the kind of place where I got left alone to do my own thing, and when I did my own thing nobody ever yelled at me, so that was nice.

My uncle Justy handed me a game card and before they could give me any lip I dove straight into that arcade ocean with reckless abandon.


## Max, 2022


Blink.

I was alone in a spacious room in a house I didn’t recognize. I could hear waves crashing over some shore I didn’t know. In front of me was a large, flat object that _must_ be a computer screen, but it's impossibly thin. How did they fit the electron guns into this thing, anyway?

The world felt smaller, somehow. Besides that, everything was just _off_. There was a glass rectangle by my hands that vibrated about once a minute - again, that impossibly crisp screen! - and the objects around me just seemed sleeker, smaller, better than what I had seen before. Some of the devices didn’t even have wires!

I got the idea to look down at my body and nearly passed out from shock. My hands patted down my chest, my crotch, my hips. Everything is not what I remember. They're softer. Nicer, in a way I couldn't quite put into words. Maybe... comfortable?

No. _Girly._ No more nasty boy body!

I checked the date: December 20, 2020. I grabbed the mouse - no ball inside anymore! - and dragged the cursor across this impossibly large screen to find a chat window. I knew it was the Cats even if I don't know how I know that.

"Hello?" I type. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

"You're new, I take it?"

"I think?"

"It's cool," Lexi responded. "You have DID. That means there's more than one of you inside your head. You're safe, you're in your home, and everything is cool. How old are you?"

"Uh..."

"In your mind," Lexi responded. "Like, are you an adult, a kid, or a teen?"

"In between kid and teen? Tween?" I laughed. Well, someone laughed. Probably the adults inside, gobsmacked at what I was saying on a chat with someone who was a total stranger to me.

"Nice. What's your name, kiddo?”

“Max,” I typed. “Like Maxine, but cooler.”

A big grin dug deep dimples into my cheeks.

“Well Max, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”  

“Thanks. I'm very confused, very excited, and more than anything I need a primer on the last twenty years of technology because this shit is blowing my _mind_ right now."

You get over the time travel eventually. Can't stay mad about missing 20+ years for the rest of your life, after all! And even though my body is pushing 40 I still feel like I'm 13, still dress like I'm 13, and I live for every compliment I get on my look. I got us through, and now I got to enjoy the fruits of that labor.

Some days, I still feel like I'm in that Block Party from our youth. But I realize now that no matter how big the dissociated ocean that separates us, we're all from the same arcades, the same base components, the same life.

We are time travelers, lost in a labyrinth of our own memory. But it’s nice to look back and see, sometimes, that things weren’t so bad.

## Addie, 2023

All the while, through all the system discovery, confusion, processing, and system negotiation, my job trudged on.

My job was supposed to be my stepping stone to the sweet life: making big bucks as an agile coach at an institutional level. subsidiary of a Fortune 100 company wanted an Agile Coach to help deliver better product. Pre-system discovery, I was a well-seasoned scrum master who came with multiple recommendations from many different industry leaders. The interview went well, and, shortly after the start of the pandemic, I accepted the new gig.

It was meant to be my big break; after I had one Agile Coaching job under my belt, the world would be my oyster. And I was good at it! I got moved around from team to team to help them improve, and things were great. I was envisioning a future with cushy, $200k+ jobs in some upscale consulting firm, and the path to that number seemed so, so easy in the pre-system days!

But then, one year into taking my shot at the new place, the system woke up. The future where I dreamed of cushy executive consulting gigs went up in smoke.

Even though I didn’t know it yet, my big-shot tech career began to end in September 2020, when the stress of work finally broke the system free.

My first boss and I got along wonderfully, even going so far as to make us feel at ease discussing our system issues openly. But as the months dragged on, and the chaos inside grew messier, our hold on “the rockstar employee” title began to slip. Even the simplest tasks, like “show up to work on time,” felt like herculean efforts. It started with missing meetings whenever syskids inside chose to throw a fit. Then: forgetfulness, a total lack of motivation, and that all culminated in a complete breakdown of my ability to get work done.

For the first time in my life, I was on the fast track to getting fired.


## Max, 2024

I don’t want to dwell on the sight stuff, but I think it’s important to know that while this was all going on I started losing my vision.

It started in November of 2022.

…that’s a lie. It started way back in 1986, when my family went to see Peter Pan at a drive-in and I couldn’t see a thing. It continued as I went from single vision lenses to bifocals, bifocals to progressives, progressives to low vision specialist gear. So yeah, I’ve known for years that going blind was going to happen with or without my permission.

But November 2022? Yeah. That’s when I couldn’t hide it anymore.

It started with a tough conversation with an optometrist, who said I was no longer able to drive at night. Then it was the retinal specialist, who agreed and referred me to a Lighthouse. (They’re an extension of the Lion’s Club that focuses on the blind and low vision community.) We talked about options for driving and options for navigating the world.

A month later, I had my first white cane and was immediately hooked. I hadn’t realized how much I craved sensory stimulation that my eyes couldn’t bring in, and the more I used the cane, the easier navigating the world got.

(Turns out, I’d been shoulder-checking light poles and tripping over potholes for years. I just forgot when it happened because we’re a system.)

A month after that, I was learning braille and VoiceOver as the text on screen started to blur to the point of uselessness. My world changed seemingly overnight, as I replaced sight-focused skills I built over years with blind-friendly actions.

Nothing changed. I was always a system and I always had low vision. But in 2023, those truths were tossed into a gigantic pressure cooker of stress that eventually exploded into a career crisis that almost ended our life.

Try as we might, we were, quite simply, not up to the task of pretending to be an abled adult human anymore. We tried - boy, did we _ever_ try! - but the ending is still the same.

Welcome to our fuckup arc.

### Sam, 7:00AM

My phone played uplifting, quiet music for my wakeup alarm. Not that I needed it in the summer, what with the sun coming up at five and the birds chirping at six, but I wanted some time to myself. I dreamed about getting up, making tea, listening to a record. Really coming to the day slowly, you know? But when I went to leave, my arms reached for Jack-Jack instead.

“No. Stay and snuggle.”

“Hi Lilith.” I forced myself to get up and walk to the bathroom.

“Work’s stupid. Stay in bed. Help the littles feel better.”

Then I was walking _back_ from the bathroom, having done nothing, so that I could pick up Jack-Jack, my newest stuffed animal. Never was a stuffie person before system discovery, but when you have a head full of kids, you end up with lots of stuffies.

As for the bathroom? Sometimes these conversations between, well, _mes_ are smoother when we can talk to each other through a mirror, like a proper crazy person should. The kid refused to let Lilith and I talk without his stuffie, so there I was, holding Jack-Jack’s bunny paw, listening to birdsong, and staring at a blurry face in the mirror that flashed childlike smiles and laughter to me whenever our eyes met.

My face snapped into sudden sternness. Lilith said, “You said the kids could watch Bluey last night.”

“Yeah, the night got away from me.”

Lilith wagged a finger at the mirror. “No, you got selfish. Zoe’s wanted to play that marble game for at _least_ 3 months now. Least you could do is throw on some Bluey for her.”

I looked at the time and pinched the bridge of my nose. Ten minutes before my first meeting, and we were already fighting— 

…wait. ten minutes? How the hell did two hours pass? I waved my fingers in front of my eyes to see if I was dreaming.

No such luck.

“What even happened last night?” I asked the mirror.

A new, calmer countenance washed over my face. Tally. “Addie was out and stole time from the littles.”

“Look, I know. I know. We’ll talk with Addie. This is all so hard to balance.”

“We have to learn.”

“I didn’t even want to be a parent.”

“But we are, and those little ones inside have so, so much patience for your bad parenting.”

Not gonna lie, even if this disorder is some elaborate psychodrama playing in my head, that one hurt.

“When’s the last time you put up the littles’ tent?”

I didn’t answer. She was already aware.

In the real world, I was facilitating a project management meeting. I looked alert, felt present, but my brain was a tangle of angry voices all screaming over one another to be heard.

“Right. Work. I’m getting Addie.”

My vision blurred and the world went dark.

### Addie, 10:03AM

I came to in the middle of my first work meeting. The scent of S’Mores Pop Tart wafted to my nose from a plate nearby. I didn’t remember we had those in the pantry, but I guess there goes my commitment to eating better breakfasts and losing some weight.

The world felt unreal and syrupy. The first two seconds after a switch always start with confusion. Either I can’t tell what day, month, or even year it is; or I can’t remember what I’m doing. There’s even a checklist for such an eventuality:

1. Scan the room for immediate danger.

2. Find a window to determine if it’s day or night.

3. If I’m in front of a computer, determine if I’m on my personal computer or on the work one.

4. Is there someone on a Zoom with me? If so, check the notes in the work folder.

5. Try to not act like a crazy person.

6. Blame your confusion on the weather, the day, or my sleep, whatever works.

My confused face showed on zoom and that spiked my anxiety to 11; did they watch me switch? Do they see it for what it is? Oh gosh, what if they all know I’m crazy and barely beginning to hold things together?

Potts’ voice echoed in my mind. “Relax. They probably see it. Remember we used to, like, assume that people saw every little detail on our face? Like, we never saw it because bad eyes, so we never learned the whole language of facial expressions enough to fake it—“

I did my best to ground. Thought about ice. Ran my finger over a braille stick. Something - anything - to keep me grounded. My head sounded like a coffee shop that had nothing but ticking clocks and anxious voices echoing around brick walls.

During all of this - all of this internal terror and drama and such - _I was still running the meeting._ My voice spoke, my hands danced across the keyboard, but I had no clue who is doing it. Lucy, maybe, based on the voice I was hearing in my head?

“Lucy, darling. Zoe wants some time to journal after your morning meetings. We kind of owe her after last night.”

I sent a thought back at her: “I mean, sure. I wish we’d keep this stuff outside of work hours though.”

Lucy shrugged. “We’re parents now, Addie. And we’re gonna be the best ones we can because they deserve it.”

“I know. I, just… yeah. Disability hard.”

“We know.”

Somehow, my body’s eyes rolled in response to the internal conversation. Shit. Now I’m eye-rolling on camera? Quick: scan the room for any sour faces or angry frowns, just in case I made another mistake.

Pay attention to the stuff people pay you for, Arcades. That’s priority one.

The call ended. My world was now fully dreamlike, and I swear to dog I could pass through walls if I cared a teensy bit less about physics. Through the haze I wrote a quick message to the team in my next meeting informing them that I had to step away for a headache.

Then: open Discord. Open up the right channel for Zoe to write in. Close Teams so that she won’t respond to messages. I took some deep breaths while double-checking the work setup to make sure it was kid-proof.

### Zoe, 10:10AM

(Pasted here from our system chat -Potts)

okay listen

hear me out

poptarts are really good, and s’mores poptarts were the best and I only got them sometimes

but they made me feel happy and safe when I didn’t feel safe at all so uh

can we just have them? I know I know addie is worried about weight

but not the poptarts

and i still want to play something tonight. I understand the marble game is boring so if you want to play video games with me instead that’s okay too. I just want to hang out and do fun things

ok bye

### Addie, 11:00AM

My head pulsed. This always happened when we got switchy. A pounding headache rumbled up from vertigo, amnesia, and confusion.

I ran the switching checklist once again before asking Zoe if I could read her entry. She said it was in the green book, and I knew immediately that that would wait until after work. Potts chimed in: “See? If you give the kids time their needs can be really small. Always give the littles what they need; they _will_ ruin your day to prove a point, if otherwise necessary.”

The next hour passed in a haze. Not a productive haze, either; this was more like one of those “stare into infinite space while your entire body refuses to move, respond, or even feel” kind of hazes. The kind that made Teams message chimes terrifying and every meeting a struggle to stay grounded.

We could hear D coming by their footsteps. They usually came up after their court call was done, mostly to check in and talk about lunch. But something about the way the footsteps fell, and the state we were in, and thinking about the book sent alarm bells ringing. Oh, fuck—

—fudge!

Okay. Hold on a second. There’s a little one with me now while I’m writing this part. Hello little one!. I don’t know who you are but you seem really nice and kind on the inside. I’ll let you pick a face and a name and tell me why you’re here, but first I have to set up some timers, okay?

I can feel my brain falling away from my control, but I’m taking deep, deep breaths to ground. I had to push the kid down for a few more moments, just to wrap up work. I looked to the calendar for my next meeting - a 1:00PM with my boss - and set a timer to wake me up at 12:45.

When that goes off, you have to let me come back, okay? We have adult responsibilities we have to do but I’m so, so glad to hear from you, kiddo!

That’s all the more encouragement it takes for the kid to take control. My eyes roll back into my skull and

### Addie, writing for a new little, 11:30AM

D’s melodic voice echoed through the hallway. “Hey Austen! Done with court! Still want to get lunch with-Oh!”

The second they turned the corner their expression changed. Gone were the daily worries, the troubles, the “adult stuff”; here they were bright and friendly, smiling, child-friendly. 

I spoke without thinking. “Hiiii I’m new and I’m little and I’m a little scared.”

“Nothing to be scared about, little one!” They clapped their hands in that way that makes kids giggle. My body giggled. “Is there anything you want to share?”

“No, I just wanted to be out and Addie said it’s okay for me to be out for lunch so I’m gonna watch some Chip and Dale and play games.”

I did _not_ okay that, mind you. Least, I don’t remember saying it. Things get hazy when you’re trying to work things out on the inside.

I’m… well. I’m trapped. The body is no longer my own, and whatever happens next is completely dependent on the kid driving the body in that moment. Scream, howl, scratch at the amnesia walls in my mind, but that lunch was to be property of this new little.

“Why am I here?”

An even bigger smile crossed D’s face. “You are safe and in 202X. You live in this condo with me, and those bad people can never, ever get to you again!”

“Cool.”

She walks to the window and opens it. The sound of a sea floods into the room along with a caucophony of road noise, ambulance sirens, and the bustling big city.

“Do you wanna see a big lake?”

I walked to the window and stared. Sure, my version of “the lake view” was a chisel-like opening between two buildings, where a smear of greenish-blue lake smeared all the way to the horizon. It wasn’t exactly exciting. But the sound? The force of water pounding the shore, the distant call of ducks raising their family in our little cove? They all sang a wonderful song for me that more than made up for my lack of vision.

“You never had a lake like this groing up, eh?”

“We went out to Raccoon Lake,” the kid said. “Back when dad bought a boat.”

“Well, this lake goes on past the horizon! It’s huge!” They gave my hair a tussle. “Do you want anything to eat? I’m sure you’re hungry because I’m hungry too!”

“Uh, yeah.” My voice is thin, reedy. _Scared. She’ll tell the others we’re here and then the guys will show up and_

“I’ll make anything you want.”

“Mac and cheese, please!”

“Okay!” They grabbed a green book from the shelf and handed it to me. “You hang tight and draw in your journal, and I’ll be right back!”

So I got some crayons and drew and drew and felt warm and safe until D returned with a kraft dinner with hotdogs cut into it. “Here you go, kiddo!”

“It’s okay if I eat in bed?”

“You can eat wherever you want! Nobody’s here to tell you otherwise!” They leaned in. “Would you like a forehead kiss, kiddo?”

“Yeah!”

They gave us the gentlest forehead kiss. They always give good kisses. “Fankoo for getting this for me.”

“Of course,” my wife replied. “Let me know if you need anything, kiddo!”


### Twi, 1:15PM

“I’m still not seeing the consistent progress I want to see.”

The voice was familiar but hazy. Authority? Boss. Boss! 

Last time I was out, it was noon on a Saturday. But here I was, sitting on a zoom call with no idea what was going on. Looking down, I saw a half-eaten bowl of mac and cheese, and an muted tablet playing Chip and Dale.

_The fuck is going on?_ I thought.

I scrambled through notes, looking for my list of “things to brag about.” There had to be something that was demonstrably better now than it was a few weeks ago, but honestly? I knew the decision was already made. I was a dead enby walking. I didn’t want to admit it yet but I knew the pattern because I’d been on the other side of the management fence before.

This was a mid-year performance review, triggered by an ADA process from my vision, and the verdict is in: I wasn’t improving enough to make the cut.

“I’m really sorry to drop this on you before a big vacation, but I wanted you to know what came out of the accommodation process. You’re still not where I need you to be.”

Inside, my body was a scramble of emotions. Terror. Fear of physical harm, if you believe it. Nausea. Vertigo. You name it, I was experiencing it. Outside, my eyes unfocused and my mouth fell slightly agape and _I want to let the world go fuzzy so the emotions stop hurting me—_

“I hope you have a great vacation, though!”

She was genuine. The news sucks but she was doing the best she can, so I smiled and waved and ended the call. Inside, I was a pile of crabs, all trying to climb to the top of the bucket to peer out on what just happened.


### Addie, 4:00PM

I came to without knowing where the day went.

There’s a beer by the work computer and I realize, to my horror, that I’m drinking during work hours. (Gotta love a good wagon fall on the company dime, I guess.) But honestly, nothing I did or say was going to make things better at work. Eseentially, my day ended before it started because I didn’t listen to the littles.

All around my office were half-finished tasks: drying loads of laundry, half-built lego structures, and the dulcet tones of a mascot professional wrestling league blaring from my computer speakers. Atop the work laptop was a green book with a sticky note: “NOT UNTIL AFTER WORK.”

Not that I needed a warning with the green book. I knew better.

This is how you survive as a mentally disabled person: you get long strings of being unable to focus at work, and then you hope for the 10x, 20x days where you have plenty of spoons to spend. When it happens, you push the accelerator to the floor, hoping to whoever will listen that the effort will get you a few weeks ahead before the bad times returned.

Like Twi said, once the board broke there was going to be a mighty mess to clean up.

I didn’t message any coworkers. Didn’t say goodbye. I just went downstairs, packed a bowl, and took a long, rough drag. Inside I could feel the others beating at the surface of my consciousness, demanding to have their say.

We were about to ride the rolodex.

For those who haven’t experienced it before, the rolodex is a state we wouldn’t wish on our worst enemy. For the next hour, we were going to rapidly cycle through alters, sometimes with as little as seconds between switches. Each switch brings with it complete amnesia, more dissociation, and confusion.

Essentially, picture giving an old rolodex a quick spin so it cycles through all your contacts, but it’s inside your brain.

Every single time the switch happened, we’d look to D and say “Hi, I am not well.” And they would give us a hug and explain, yet again, that the system wrote in the green book today.

I’m not well, indeed. This system stuff is for the fucking birds.


### Potts, 10:00PM

“I think I finally have control.”

I was on the couch with my wife. My eyes were moist - pillow, too, and my body was twisted to both be as fetal and as close to D as possible. A breath later, my shoulders relaxed.

“It’s an adult on this end,” I said.

“Mostly,” D said with a laugh.

“Oh hush. I’m grown now.” They were referring to last year, when I acted like a 9 year old boy. Lots of poop jokes, of course, care of our main subscriber Butthole Spas, where your number two is our number one priority. (You’re welcome, D!) But since that time, I’ve become sort of a system dad.

“Bad night?”

I shrugged. “I guess, yeah. Not like I can remember it.”

“Yeah.”

We were silent for a moment. On the coffee table was the green book from earlier, and inside were drawings of a naked child being held at knifepoint.

“I just… it’s hard to believe, D. Fucking terrifying.”

Their voice, calm and measured, relaxed me. “I’ve met the kids, hon. This is all real.”

“I just… yeah.” Addie shaded in to talk for a moment. “I’m just afraid of being this disabled. I feel like this is my last chance to have a career before I’m too disabled to get a job.”

“That’s not true.”

“I know. I just feel it.”  I tried to chuckle, but switching Addie back out was taking my all my concentration. “Fuck. I’m hungry. Did we get too high?”

“I didn’t pay attention.” This was D-speak for “You probably had more than you think because of your amnesia.” When I ask inside nobody can really tell me how much I’ve had.

“It’s 10, right? Did we eat dinner?”

“Yes.”

“Fuck it. I’ve got the munchies and am ordering delivery. If I’m gonna have to go out tonight with a flashback-brain I’m at least going out the way I want to: full of delicious steamed trash.” 

Steamed trash, in this case, represents of the greatest gifts the Midwest has ever given the world. Thousands have made pilgrimages here just to sample its heavenly, oniony aroma. It’s grandeur can be seen on the silver screens of the world, but truly, to know this, the True Face of God Arisen as Fast Food, you must journey to the middle of nowhere, USA and sidle up for a 10-sack.

I was talking, of course, about a big ass bag of White Castle sliders.

D laughed. “I’m out. How in the hell are you going to hit delivery?”

I raised an eyebrow. “Ordering enough to _get_ delivery is just one part of the challenge.”


### Addie, 8:00AM

I woke with a shot. Outside, birds sang and the tide washed in fresh seaglass from Lady Michigan. Inside, I felt like my stomach was demanding to speak to the manager.

“You should look at your phone,” my wife told me.

I stood - mostly because otherwise I’d puke - and made my way downstairs while looking at the photos presented for me. There, the remains of a feast of ten sliders, fries, and at least one mozzarella stick covered the coffee table.

The photos showed a veritable burger bouquet, with multiple types of sliders and a mini-buffet of different dips to try. The bastard had even pulled out our silly turkey serving plate to lay the burgers out all fancy-like, and he added balsamic drizzle for garnish.

_A balsamic drizzle._

“What day is it, D?”

“Saturday.”

I breathed deep - not too deep - and heaved a belch.

“What the fuck happened yesterday?” I asked, and D just laughed.

## Twi, 2024

One of the most annoying symptoms of DID is also one of the more bizarre: a person with DID will rabidly deny they have the disorder.

The system will twist itself into mental pretzels trying to doubt the existence of alters within the body. We spent the better part of a year trying to argue ourselves out of being a system, each of us choosing different arguments to make the case that this is something else - schizophrenia, bipolar, *anything* but DID.

Because the system worked best when it was hidden. It kept us alive when the worst things happened because nobody knew we were a lot of people in a single head. The brain’s not exactly pining to let go of its defense mechanism so easily. So each of us would step up to the plate, make our case to the other alters in the system on why we couldn’t possibly exist as a “we,” and then the alters would fight it out in hours-long conversations that dragged on into the night.

Again, these conversations were about how we *couldn’t possibly have alters.* This disorder, man.


## Addie, 2008

“Goddamn it, I told you all that I wasn’t writing a trans memoir.”

The words echoed around the arcade inside. Not one single alter responded, of course. None of us particularly enjoyed being back in the aughts. It was a rough time and we put in so, so much work to delete the memory from our history. But I guess Twi wants to touch on it, so I’m stuck writing about it.

The year 2009 was, without a doubt, the worst year of my life. The cruelty of this year transformed me body and soul. My old life fell completely apart, and from its ashes I built who I am today.

…And I guess it’s the first year I met Tally, so that’s worth a chapter at least.


## Zoe, 1988

I found out the difference between boys and girls when I was four years old and I didn’t have a word big enough to describe how much I hated being on the wrong side. I tried trepidatious (my mom likes it) but that’s not quite it. Dead? No. I wasn’t really dead so that didn’t work either. But… uh, what’s the feeling you get when you get in trouble but it’s not your fault and you know you’re gonna have to take someone else’s punishment?

Well, like that times a thousand for little me.

The first day of preschool I got to have recess with all my new friends. It was the 80s then: the playground was full of metal jungle gyms, a small dirt pit with a basketball hoop, and some toys piled near the shed which housed them. I tried to join the girls on the swings. I didn’t know why but i liked them better and I didn’t want to play with the gross boys in the basketball dirt pit. It was so messy there!

I sat at a swing and waited for the girls to say hi.

“What are you doing?” one girl said. She had curly blonde hair, I remembered that most of all. This little girl with curly, blonde hair sneering at boy-me.

“I wanna play,” I said. I smiled. People like when you smile at them. Mom taught me that. Maybe it would be enough to earn their friendship—?

“You’re a boy,” she snapped, pointing to the mud pit where boys were currently roughhousing over a ball. I didn’t want to go over there, but I didn’t want to be alone, so I swallowed the lump in my throat and tried my best to blend in with the boys.

When I came back inside from recess I was filthy dirty and super sad, but I didn’t cry. Dad would be proud.

But I had a secret weapon for this kind of sadness: I can just forget it.

I was four and I know the best magic trick ever. I could just stop crying or being excited or anything if I tried hard enough. It was like, uh, like popping my knuckles but in my brain and when I do it I feel better. It helps when people yell at me.

So I thought really hard about it - like, really really hard! - until my brain popped. I didn’t care about the girls anymore, or that my clothes were filthy. It was easier when I tried to be what other people wanted anyways because then people didn’t figure out how weird I was.

I figured out how to be a good boy. Eventually. Mom and Dad would be proud.


## Tally, 2008

This wasn’t the first time Addie and I met. For that, you have to go back to a furry con in Michigan, where I dressed up as a girl, picked up a guy at a furry con, and ruined a lot of my friends nights in the process. I promise I can explain.

The con itself was a bit of a mess. It was in one of those old Holiday Inn resort hotels, where there's a pool and a hot tub and a sauna and a bunch of open space for loosely organized activities. Years after the fact we would discover that the con organizer was a nazi, but at the time we were having fun with friends at a tiny con. There was always free beer on tap, and as a freshly-minted, post-college adult I got into the sauce quite a bit.

But the drunker I got, the less I could hear the others and the more I could feel my heart buzzing with thoughts of Brandon.

My coming out at the con came in fits and starts from there. I told everyone that I'm a girl, at one point. Or at least that I wasn’t a boy. And after throwing on a skirt and top that I brought for the occasion I convinced everyone to go to the dance with Brandon.

It's a mess of a dance. There are lasers, smoke machines, house music, and folks in fursuits swaying to the music all around us. But I was dancing with him, and honestly? And in that dance, all I could see is Brandon.

He had the most beautiful eyes. Clean shaven. And there's this wonderful spot under his strong chin where I could nock my head into the small of his chest and sway with him. We're enveloped in green lasers and fog that smelled like lemon pledge and when he throws his arms around my tunic I just feel like... like me. Completely and totally me, in a way that had never happened before.

We tumbled to the floor together. he straddled me. (Look. Furry cons in the aughts were weird.) Our foreheads touched; his fingers caressed my check like a feather. I was… I know that there, in that moment, I'm his girl. And nobody in my head can tell me otherwise.

"I want you," he said. His gentle smile filled my head with a pink haze, impossible to think through. I felt pressure at the back of my head and tried my best to tamp it back down.

His bright eyes shone like galaxies, his soft smile filled me with gentle confidence. It was then, or never again. Even if I hurt people that day, you have to understand. I thought this was the one and only chance I’d ever have to be seen as, well, _me_.

"I want to sleep with him," I told my girlfriend. Her face scrunched up with disgust. I know that Potts would have read between the scrunched-up lines of her shocked face, that I should have retracted the request, give Brandon a hug, and gone back to the hotel room with her. We would have laid in bed. Cuddled. Cried. I would have apologized for letting myself be a girl in front of everyone.

But it’s not who I want to be in that moment, so I promptly ignore the warning signs. “Please,”

"If it will get this out of your system," she says, lingering on system. Her fingers curl around mine with a weak grip, but I had what I wanted out of the conversation. I turned to Brandon with a smile that sparkled like a thousand suns.

I was his girl that night.

I was a girl.


## Potts, 2008

I woke up that morning in a my friend Brandon's bed, naked, his taste on my tongue. Panic set in. I got out of the bed, knowing I did something wrong, but not exactly knowing why. My phone had dozens and dozens of missed calls, missed texts, and pleas for me to pick up. Nobody else in my friend group slept that night; they stayed up in the laundry room comforting our girlfriend. *My* girlfriend.
 
Why couldn’t I remember last night? Why did I sleep with this guy if I don’t even like men?
 
"Everything okay?" Brandon asks.
 
I gathered my clothes. 
 
"No."
 
He chuckled. "First time with a guy? I can smell the shame from here."
 
"No. Been with men before, no hangups there. Just... that was reckless."
 
He smiled at me. "You were beautiful last night, dear."
 
"Dear?"
 
The memories come flooding back. The skirt. The dancing. The… way I let him take care of me, like his girl. His *girl*.
 
"You got your girlfriend’s permission. I heard it."
 
"I know. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me."
 
"It's fine."
 
I scrolled through the messages on my phone. “Gods, these texts. I ruined everything. This is their *hotel room*, and I locked them out all night to sleep with you. They're in the laundry room right now. Have been all night. God *damnit*, I'm not this asshole."
 
Brandon gathered the sheets around him as he sat up. "Look, it's an innocent mistake. And they could have come in at any time - we could always have gotten dressed."
 
The texts started up again. "I have to go," I say.
 
He looked to the bed, defeated. I put a hand on his shoulder. "This wasn't your fault. It's my fault for getting you into this."

“Thanks.” I left him to pick up his clothes at his own pace.

*It's always my fault.* I repeated as I ran to the laundry room. I found my girlfriend there, staring out the window stern look on her face. I was about to get the shit scolded out of me.
 
"Why did you do it?" she asked.

I pleaded with her with my eyes. "I don't know."
 
"You're serious."
 
"Yes," I say. "I just... I don't know what came over me. I'm not a girl. I'm not into men. and I'm in love with you." Two truths, one lie, but at that point I'd say whatever it took to make this conversation end. Not knowing how it would end was making me feel queasy and deeply uncomfortable.
 
I couldn’t remember any of it.

"I can't believe you'd do this to me."
 
"I can't either."

We dropped it and tried to enjoy our last night at the con, but I had to teach high school the next day and proceeded to have a full-on panic attack about it in front of all my friends.

Misty got tail. I got panic attacks, a drama bomb in my friend group, and generally given the short end of the stick. Being plural is a bitch, sometimes.


## Sam, 2006

I got ma’amed for the first time at a Halloween frat party.

To start with, we went to an all-male college. (We got better, though!) And every Halloween since our freshman year we made a point to dress up as a girl for a costume. The queer community where I live used to call Halloween “Trans Christmas”, as it gave us genderweird folk an ironclad excuse to give new gender presentations a try. Either you got a laugh out of your friends, or you got genuine compliments about how nice you look as a girl.

I remembered the dress so clearly: it was a salvage shop find from Lafayette, IN, where I would go out dressed to avoid getting clocked by anyone I knew. It was this red, yellow, and orange floral print sundress, and I paired it with black mary-janes to pull the look together.

(This was before the time of cell phone cameras, so nobody has photo evidence of this moment actually happening. Which is fantastic, because early transition pictures make me cringe.)

I was also zooted; a friend had just offered a gravity bong hit and whatever was in the pipe had me moon-rocks high. Everyone else said getting high chilled their brain out but for me, I could start talking to other people in my head. It was really weird, but the others are pretty cool with meeting up here and there for a party, long as I forgot about talking to them afterwards.

A friend - we’ll call him Matt - called me over to the beer pong table and I obliged him. We were halfway through a game when I felt a tap at my shoulder.

“Where’s your costume?” he said. When I turned I realized it was another friend - we’ll call him Chad - who legit did not recognize me in a dress. Usually I’d have told him straight away but I had a sudden impulse in the moment.

What if I just let him think I’m a girl?

I tried the voice one of the trans girls at the Blind Pig taught me. “I’m here with a friend.”

“A friend?” His lips curled. “Not a boyfriend, I hope.”

The words lit a blazing fire in my heart. I’d been seen before. Adored even. Victory parties? I’ve had em. Girlfriend? Yep, right there at the corner of the room, sulking while I wore the biggest smile. There should have been nothing different about this attention, but why was my heart pounding a million times a minute and my stomach covered in butterflies?

I was being pursued. Like a real girl.

“You’re cute,” he said. My heart took flight. Not for Chad, per se. But that, for the first time, someone _saw_ me.

It was around that time Matt checked in on the conversation and blew it for me. “Oh hey, buddy. That’s Austen in the dress!”

The spell broken, he pushed away from me. I tried to play it off as a joke. “Thanks for the kind words, sugar,” I said, giving a curtsey for good measure. We laughed it off as a joke in the moment, but that blossoming, sweet feeling stuck with me for months. Being seen, pursued, adored.

I was hooked.


## Samantha, 2007

The adults wanted to show our girlfriend how to play disc golf but I wanted to lay down in the grass so there we were, in the fairway of the disc golf course, staring at blades of grass and trying to keep the lid on the big secret.

The big secret would kill us. We know that because our family didn’t like gay people and well, they made us act manly. But laying on that grass, the blades tickling my arms, I just wanted the pain of living in the wrong body to be over.

I wanted to stop hiding.

I wanted to be a girl.

Yeah I know we were in college but I hated everything about my body and if I had my vote I’d have just started transition when we went to college. But Addie wanted to finish school first, which was dumb but at least she lets me get dressed on the weekends here and there as long as I did it in Lafayette where nobody can see me.

I stared at the grass and yelled at the other voices to go away. That helped sometimes - if I got really sad, or really upset, they’d just go away because they were scared of the emotions. So I imagined going home to see dad and that got everyone to run away real quick.

“Are you okay?” my girlfriend asked. Well, she’s the system’s girlfriend, not my girlfriend. I was too young for that. She’s uh, well, we call our wife “big friend” when this happens so I guess the girlfriend was a big friend too.

“I want to be a girl.”

“Are you sure?”

“More than anything.”

“Then let’s get started,” she said, and I felt the system rumble and roar with rage. The world shrank to a pinpoint, popped out of existence, and I was back in the dark place while the adults undid everything I had done.


## Addie, 2009

I was twenty-five years old and making twelve dollars an hour without health insurance. Of course I didn’t go to a therapist when I started hearing the voices. Instead, I tried to talk them down on my own.

We were in a nondescript parking garage on the north side of Indianapolis walking home from the call center. We worked for a skeezy life insurance company whose sales model looked very, shall we say, pyramid-shaped from my perspective as this low level contracted tech. But they paid, and the job wasn’t too hard, so there we stayed.

At that point in my history I was a regimented, terrified mess of a human being. Every morning at 10 I’d wake up, dress like a guy, and apply to jobs. Sometimes at home, sometimes at whatever job fair was going at the time hoping to be seen. Every night and weekend I’d dress up in comfortable women’s clothes and marvel at how my body was changing.

When I wasn’t doing that I was either drunk or talking to the people in my head and trying to make sense of the what was happening.

Back in the parking garage I was talking to myself: “So if I were to think of a number–”

“It doesn’t work that way,” Tally said. “I have no clue what number you’re thinking of. That’s the whole point of amnesia barriers.”

“So we can hold a conversation, and I don’t have to dream up what you’re saying. It just pops into my head.”

She slid into our car and pulled the mirror so that we could look at our own reflection: the closest thing to a face-to-face meeting we could muster. “We are two separate people, Addie. Of course you can’t fill in the blanks for me.”

“Am I like, possessed or something?”

“Maybe,” Tally made the body shrug. “Look, I’m not a theologist or anything. Just a voice in your head that wants to help.”

I wanted to fight her on this, but I know better. When you’ve gone from white collar professional with career aspirations to hourly tech support, there’s sort of nowhere to go but up. I was laid low and Tally knew it.

She finished the thought for me. “I’ve been waiting for you to hit rock bottom, yes. It’s the only ay you’d believe me.”

“That’s not true.”

She started the car. “Girl, I live in this body with you. Don’t lie.”

“So what do we do now?“

“New job, to start with. We keep hustling and hoping.”

“I’m tired, though.”

“We can be tired once we have a good paying job,” Tally responded, using my mouth, my lips, my voice to chide me. I can’t emphasize enough how strange and puppet-like I felt when the body starts moving on its own.

“Maybe I can talk to mom and dad,” I offered. “Try to smooth things over, get some networking help–”

“Fuck them,” Tally said. “I know you can’t remember why, but fuck them. We’re better off leaving them in our dust.”


## Misty, 2001
I hid a bag of girl’s clothes in my car trunk that would only come out in my basement room at mom’s.

I didn’t bother with it at dad’s because it was far, far too dangerous to try. But here at mom’s, it got eerily quiet at night and everyone slept super sound. If I kept the lights low and didn’t make much noise I could try things on and see how I felt.

I was seventeen years old and trying on girl clothing for the first time.

The look was a disaster, of course. I paired an off-the-shoulder, dingy heather top with a maroon, salvage-shop skater skirt. But it was the closest I’d ever come to building a full outfit instead of stealing my sister’s clothes, and I wanted to see what it would look like. So I slung a borrowed bra onto my chest, the shirt, the skirt, and just as the look was impossible to take off quickly I heard a flush of the toilet above me. 

I laid in bed for a half hour with the lights out, wrapped tightly in the covers, terrified that if someone heard me while using the bathroom they’d check in on me. Then I stood - slowly, quietly! - from the bed and flipped on the lights next to the mirror.

I was a mess.

Let me make my point clear: the word “travesty” doesn’t even begin to cover this look, and that’s even keeping in mind that travesty is actually based on a term used for trans women in France. It was ugly, hung weird off my well-muscled body, and I wouldn’t have been found dead outside of my room in this getup.

But the potential was _there_.

I stuffed the bra and threw on a snapback to cover up my haircut. The figure in the mirror softened as I spun the skirt to hide my lack of hips. Then, in the blink of an eye, I saw myself, visibly female.

I felt as if someone had dropped a rock in the still pond that was my mind, and those ripples picked up speed until they were full-on tidal waves pounding on the edges of my heart.

“My body is _wrong_.“ I said it to the the reflection in the mirror. ”I’m a girl.“

Then: ”I can’t let anybody know about this.“

The next morning, while taking out the trash, I slipped the skirt and shirt into the garbage while no one was looking and popped my brain so I didn’t get hurt missing the outfit.

Turns out being able to voluntarily forget things can come in handy, sometimes.



## Misty, 2008

I got my first shot of estrogen in a clandestine clinic in Indianapolis. It took up the second floor of a greystone just north of downtown, placed in a residential district. The sign was hidden, too; the only way in was to know someone who knew someone. (Protests would have shut that place down if they knew about it.) But there I was, looking out the window and trying to calm the terror in my heart, looking at a needle full of yellowish oil that hovered above my thigh.

I knew that starting hormones would kick off a shitstorm at home. I knew that I’d lose my entire family for daring to do this. But I had to. There was no choice; only gravity invariably leading to the conclusion that I was a woman.

Estelle, the nurse, calmed me with a hand on the knee. “It’s just a shot,” she offered. “You’re going to be okay.”

“I know.” I looked outside. What would mom do when she finds out I did this behind her back? Sure, I was 23 and she can’t do anything about it, but she always got angry when I do something without running it by her first. Maybe I could refuse the shot and run it by her, just in case–

Estelle almost had to snap her fingers to get my attention, but when she did the took my hand into hers. “This moment is for you. Not for anybody else. Do you still want this?”

I nodded.

“Let’s do it,” I said, and Momma Estelle plunged the needle that started this whole journey.

In time, Estelle would become known as my Mother, the kind of setup that you’d see in 80s drag balls. Her and Aunt Vicky and Aunt Asia would spend the next few years making sure I could function in the world as a woman, offering makeup tips, hand-me-downs, and a shoulder to cry on when needed.

In that moment, though, she was another villager helping to raise this idiot. And honestly, this is all I ever wanted when I came out as trans. Not to defend myself, not to haggle over how much someone will accept the new me. I just needed someone to hold my hand and tell me it was okay.

When I left the office my heart felt like it could burst with joy. I turned on the loudest, girliest summer pop I could and sang at the top of my lungs for fear that holding in this emotion would actually kill me. And to this day, I’m still angry that this amazing moment, one of the happiest of my life, had to be experienced alone because I didn’t trust my family enough to be a part of the experience.


## Lilith, 2024

It was never about respect with my parents. I’m still not even sure what they wanted out of me.

All I ever wanted out of them was an "I love you" or an "I support you." That's _it_. Instead, I had to claw every little bit of interaction out of them because me being queer was icky to them, and that I had been angry when I initially came out fourteen years ago.

I could dress the facts up all I wanted but the fact remains bare: "you are trans, and we hate that about you."

It's not who you eventually become that proves your love. I’ve seen my fair share of people be transphobic and eventually come around to be girls themselves. (I’m mostly joking. Mostly.) People change, and we all become better along the way. That’s normal.

Maybe they chose rejection out of fear. Maybe their religion was against it. Maybe they worried what the town would think. But in that moment, in that split second between listening to their child bear their heart and opening their mouth, they chose rejection

Once you’ve been rejected like that, there is no reconciliation. And for folks like us, the second you show that hand, we can no longer trust you. You become dangerous. Radioactive, even, to my chances of survival. Either we can trust someone entirely or we can’t trust them at all, and our parents proved over and over again that they were not to be trusted.

The others may disagree about airing this part out loud but you know what? Good fucking riddance to my parents. My heart is lighter and brighter for letting them go.


## Addie, 2008

We spent our first Christmas alone at the age of 24. I’d recently lost my job, my girlfriend, and my stable living situation, all in a matter of weeks. I’d scraped up enough to lease an apartment in a crimey part of town, and if I didn’t find a job in the next fourteen days I wouldn’t be able to make rent.

I also had my tonsils out a week ago, so that’s fun.

I was about three months into hormone replacement therapy, and I wasn’t sure if the constant crying is my hormones being off or things being just that bad.

We didn’t remember much about the day other than that we were drunk on cheap vodka, full of Kraft Dinner, and stalking Facebook, flipping through photos of my mother’s third wedding.

I had not been invited this time around. Reason: I’m a girl now. I think she said something to the tune of “I can’t bear to hear your voice or see your face.” Christmas was cancelled too, and I felt afraid of showing to my dad’s family’s thing for some unknown reason, so there I was. Alone on Christmas, with a belly full of hyperprocessed mac and cheese, crying over all the people in those pictures that I could never see again.

To this day, I do not celebrate Christmas because of this moment. No joke. Over the course of the last three months I’d been ridiculed, rejected, insulted, and generally treated as a pariah and a bother by my family. A switch flipped in me, and for the first time in my life I learned how to say no.

“No mother, I won’t go to another therapist to prove this to you.”

“No, I’m not stopping this treatment.”

“No. I don’t care what the town thinks.”

“No, it’s not negotiable.”

And then, from her: “No, you’re not welcome here anymore.”

I heard a voice echoing from the bedroom of my apartment. “Was it worth it?”

“You bet your ass,” I replied.

To nobody.

In a 1 bedroom apartment I didn’t share.

“Wait, what the fuck was that?”


## Tally, 2009

For the first time, Addie and I met each other. Like, really truly saw each other. It’s hard to explain with words, but most times, when you’re a system you have big mood swings and don’t know how to react to them, right? But you can’t remember being emotional because that’s dangerous, so you forget that you’re sad or mad or whatever, and poof! The emotion’s just gone.

Problem was, we didn’t know where all the wayward emotions go. Turns out, you can only stuff emotions down so far before things start breaking. Your brain is very, very capable of forgetting, but the garbage is still there, festering in some far-off corner of your brain.

I walked the mirror to look at myself. I still had the masculine jaw line, still had stubble, and still felt like I was making a huge mistake.
 
And because of my gender I was spending Christmas alone. Or at least I thought so.  

"That's my face?"  
  
We weren't sure who said it but when we got to the mirror the world felt unreal and strange.

"Who are you?” Addie asked aloud.

My face scrunched for a moment. I yawned. The world went fuzzy, and then I was back in control of the body.

"I'm Tally. I'm here to help."

"Help with what?"

"Confidence." My lips curled into a gentle smile. "You made a good decision, starting transition. You _feel_ better. Now I want us to live like it."

"Okay, so I'm officially crazy."

"As a loon. But there's good news too: you are a girl! And you get to meet me!"

I laughed. What else are you supposed to do when the reflection in the mirror talks back to you? I thought about trying to sleep, or recalling the day to make sure I wasn't drunk or something, but my body was no longer my own. I felt like a puppet on strings, controlled by an invisible hand that was at once my own body and a complete stranger driving at the wheel.

So yeah. I started transition, lost my family, and nearly lost my apartment at 23, 2 months into the Great Recession. How'd that go? Let's just leave it at "we didn't handle it well."


## Misty, 2021

Mom would make a point to reach out a few times over the years that followed.

Like the time during the pandemic when we had a relationship for about six months. She started calling because her father was dying, and I guess that got her to thinking about me?

And me, being the sucker I am, I believed her at her word: it was just talking, after all. Nothing bad could come from that.

First red flag I should have seen was that there was never reconciliation. Or even an apology. Just "how's life," like I'd been off on a European vacation for the past few years. We must never talk about the conflict directly, after all!

"I just wish you hadn't been so harsh at the start," she said. It has been 14 years since 2008 and we're still talking about three months in that year like it's the worst thing I've ever done.

"I was in a rough spot," I said, shrugging. Looking back always got me apologetic. There was always something to look back on and apologize for, some thing I did wrong that I still couldn't atone for. But at least I had a mom again. “You abandoned me.”

“You were too harsh,” she replied.

I even _visited Indiana_ at this time, and she had the gall to pretend the past didn't exist at all. That she was always an ally, that she had never thrown me out into the cold, that she and I had been buds for a long, long time. It was exhausting!

I told her that I had DID. Her response: "Oh, okay."

Thing was, it wasn't about the disagreement. Not about me being a trans woman. It wasn't even about the abuse! It was how I had embarrassed her in front of the town, how I had grown past her.

Her favorite response was silence. Oh, my mom was a master of the silent treatment! Never discussed, never directly said, she'd send family members to try and talk me out of transition, sometimes. She'd freeze you out of a family for saying a single bad word of her, I swear to you. And Lord help you if you are queer and want to be in her good graces!

Fast forward to November 2021. It was my birthday and we’d just recently rediscovered the system. We were a mess, but at least we're trying to heal. I was still heady from the whole "my mom loves me again" arc of my relationship with mom, so when my birthday came around all I wanted was a phone call and a check-in.

I waited. Nothing.

I called. Answering machine.

I texted: "Are you okay? Just wanted to check in."

An hour went by. I tried not to think about it but the silence was starting to eat at me. Was she okay? Maybe I'd said something to upset her again. Maybe she was in hospital for another surgery - she had a lot of surgeries when I was growing up.

Three hours later I get a response: "This is your sister. Mom isn't talking to you because you told someone in town you weren't talking to her, and that hurt her feelings. She'll reach out when she's ready."

I'm not too proud to say this made me fall out. Hard. Turns out giving a system the silent treatment is a guaranteed way to get the kids in the system whipped into a crying spree. Of _course_ I’d screwed this up again. Of _course_ I'd say something to push her away again; that's all I'm good at!

The thoughts swirled in my head as D and I considered our options over champagne and somber music.

"I'm so sorry," D said. "I had a feeling this would happen sooner or later."

"I know. I just wish—“

Silence.

"What?"

"I wish I could do something," I said, smiling. "And actually, I think we can."

I pulled out my phone and opened up our system chat. It was an app grafted onto a platform called Discord that allowed me to "converse" with proxied avatars of my alters. Other systems turned me on to it and we'd been living with the system server as a constant companion for months at that point. We ran every decision through it, big or small, so that everyone inside could have equal say in decisions that affected our life.

I typed out a message:

"What do we do about mom?"

My fingers sped across the keys without my prompting.

"Dump her."

"She's fucked around for the last time. Time she finds out."

"She's a meanie!"

I looked to D. “I… I think we're in agreement on this one. That's weird."

"Weird?"

"For years, when she'd do this I'd shut down. Felt like I made a mistake, and that I had to make it right. I'd write her letters, or sit with her while she sulked. Something, anything to make things better."

"What changed?"

"For the first time in a long time? We know she's in the wrong."

"Yeah?"

"And we can vote on taking our next action," I finished with a smile. “We’re done with her.


## Tally, 2008

All our life we've made ourselves small to avoid being seen.

First it was to avoid being bullied at school. I’d watch my own body language like a hawk to make sure I didn't make myself a target. Then at home I kept busy with quiet, lonely activities to keep from exposing too much of my personal self to people who could hurt us. Stuff like painting, or listening to music, or writing.

Oh, writing! We loved to write precisely because many folks in our family hated reading. I could write thinly-veiled pieces of fiction that told people the truth about how I was being treated, and nobody was the wiser. Once I started getting older I pushed harder into the writing; choosing to skip dinners out, movies, other activities to have the most serene moments of calm and clarity that came alongside an empty, quiet home.

I spent my entire high school career hiding and my college career trying to peek out from under the fear. But transition? That wasn’t something you can do "small." Certainly not in this year of our Lord 2008! After five years of an abusive relationship and a lifetime of hiding myself for fear of reprisal, I was mighty tired of the dance by the time my mom invited me over to talk about "the trans thing." And of course, I said yes.

In the five years between my coming out and this conversation we’d barely been in contact. I kept up with monthly emails updating her on how life is been. In return, I got emails about how she "couldn't bear to see my face" and that my "voice makes her cry." But suddenly she's sweet as honey, all smiles and nostalgia as we went through the kayfabe of a normal family dinner. Long as you ignore the tension you could squint your eyes and see a normal conversation.

At least I get to see my dog again. Silver linings have been worse before.

Addie didn’t attend this meeting. She has a bad habit of, well, rolling over for our family, for lack of a better word. This wasn’t a day for surrender. So as we sat in the living room, rum and cokes in hand, I poked the elephant in the room:

"Okay. You dropped me like a bad habit for five years. What changed?"

"Oh, it's not that big a thing!" My mom has that tone to her voice. I don't have a good word for it, but it feels cloying, desperate. Weak, in some ways, but the message was delivered with confidence. "I just wanted to check in with you."

"That's not why we are here," I said. There was silence. I sipped at my drink. My dog did her level-headed best to merge with my lap; after so many years apart I was going to have to pry this dog off with a crowbar.

“Stop. Tell me what you want from me, or I walk."

Addie would _never_ say that. It’s why this fight had to be mine; I had the spine for it.

"You don't have to be touchy about it!" she said, half joking. My stern face told her otherwise. (Somewhere deep inside I felt anger, hatred, and rage boiling up -- food for thought later, after I was out of the house. For now, focus on the prize. Nail down her ask.)

"I heard you're going to Thailand for surgery."

It’s true; in a month I’d be boarding a plane to Thailand to visit Dr. Suporn for bottom surgery. I had already paid a five-figure deposit to secure my surgery date.

Of course. The fight was always about my gender.

"He's the best in the world," I said with a shrug. "Wasn't going to trust it to anyone else. I fly out next week and am very excited--"

"It seems so dangerous," she said. “Maybe you should get a second opinion.”

“Mom, I’m already in for twelve thousand dollars. You’re a little late to stop me.”

“Still, what if something happens?”

I should have been surprised. It would have been so much easier if it were surprise; I could have been impressed by the sheer balls of my mother ignoring me for five years only to reach out and try and ask me to stop my transition. Like I owed her a favor or something. I couldn’t help laughing.

"Oh my god, mom."

"Hear me out!"

"You have no right to ask that."

"It just seems dangerous. Maybe you and I could, I don't know, sit together and figure this out?"

I was full-on laughing at that point. What else do you do when someone's suckered you in with a homecooked meal only to sell you on some pipe-dream of a reality where I was not trans and things went back to the place where I was miserable and small, but loved by the family?

"That's what this was about? Butter me up so you can talk me out of the surgery?"

"I just don't think you've given this enough thought--"

“You're too late. And furthermore, you're _way_ out of line, pretending you have enough of my respect to ask me to throw my dream away. How dare you!”

"I never said that."

"You did. 'What will the neighbors think?', I believe you said. February. 2009.” I pointed to the kitchen table. “We sat right there when I came out as trans and you said those words. I’ll never forget them."

The smile gave way to a sneer. It always gave way to the sneer, once you said no to whatever she asked. That's just how mom was. And here, cornered and now exposed, she went to the only thing she knew: blame. "You didn't even get a second opinion, and you tore the family apart by how meanly you came out as trans--"

I stood from the living room chair. “If this is your plan, there’s no reason for the conversation to continue. I’m going to Thailand, and I’m leaving right now.”

"Don't be like this."

"Don't call me." I walked out of the house and my dog, ever faithful, tried to follow me home. Looking back, I wish I'd have taken the pooch up on it. She was the only thing I ever wanted from that house, in retrospect.


## Addie, 2021

I kept it short and sweet when I texted my mom back:

"I've spent 14 years waiting for you to see that I'm good enough for you and every time you break my heart. I'm done. Lose my fucking number."

It was then I learned a new rule in my relationship with my mother: if you need a call from her, call her out. My phone started ringing off the hook.

I refused the first call. Immediate callback. Then two. Then three. Each call made me crumple even further into a ball, children inside howling with the terror that we had made mom angry, and that her anger meant we were the bad kid, and the only way to make things better was to do exactly what she wants— 

"I'm taking this," D said as they grabbed my phone and, bless their heart, tanked my sister's angry phone call for me. I heard them howling on the phone downstairs as I tried to calm down all the parts inside terrified that we did it wrong again, and everyone was going to blame us for it going bad. Just breathe, in, three, two, one, out…

# To Be Someone Else for One Day
Sometimes I get tired of doing the same thing
Sit still while the people around me are changing
One day I’m gonna find the feeling
What it’d be like
to be someone else for one day?

## Twi, 2021

Sometimes, when things are going terrible, you have to try a new life to get perspective on the one you live.

I have this, uh, thing I like to do. You know how some people like to travel? It’s sort of like that, but more. I’d leave the airport in Chicago alone and arrive in the host city an empty vessel who just moved to town. Instead of sightseeing, I wanted to make friends in the city, share their lives and, well, try to be someone else for one day.

In the aughts, my second life was as a girl in Chicago. In the teens, I was a polyamorous transbian immigrant to perennially weird Toronto. Here, at the end of my rope, I knew exactly what to reach for to get me back on the straight and narrow: a new adventure.

I never understood why we were like this. Maybe this was some weird wanderlust that I never quite got over while moving to Chicago. Maybe it was just my particular weird hobby. Maybe — (and by this he means “definitely” -Misty) — this was the way we made our divergent life paths work.

Being a system is about compromising. We all wanted different things out of life. Gender, career, relationships, hobbies, you can bet we disagree on what to focus our energies on. But out here, in a new city, I get to meet people for the first (and often last) time. With that many at-bats, we got to experiment with what kind of person we wanted to be as a whole system.

I can’t tell you how freeing that was: to know that we could be as inconsistent, weird, and out there as we wanted and _nobody would know about it at home_. It was raw energy in my veins.

Landing in Seattle, I felt like I grew ten years younger, I had so much energy.

This is all a long way of saying that, between the trouble at work and the mess with my dad, I decided to say fuck it, time for a trip to Seattle to see the Cats and meet a whole bunch of systems.

Over the course of the past year the Cats and I had struck up a bit of a relationship over text. At first it was her helping us out, but as we got to know each other as people (and as alters in systems!), we struck up a friendship that bubbled into a little bit of a romance.

That romance lead to meeting a whole new crew of trans, plural folks in Seattle, and the one thing I thought I could do to improve my mental health was fully immerse in the role. Be somewhere where, if you do fall apart, there will be no witnesses at home.

Yeah, my friends in Chicago were amazing and would never think to hurt me with anything I trusted them with, but. Well. Old habits die hard.

So I got the OK from my wife, bought a ticket out to Seattle, and planned to work remotely for the course of a full week with my trans, lesbian, furry, plural system friends. (Look, you picked up a book written by a blind, polyamorous, plural, autistic, furry lesbian. Let’s all be honest and say “we knew this was coming.”)

## Addie, 2011

…right. So in the teens, back when I was running around Toronto and working on how best to pronounce “sorry,” I was driving back home to Indiana and there was this line at the Michigan border. I’d just had the best weekend of my life hanging with my partners in the area, and to be honest, it’s still up there for “best weekends of my life.” (Hard to beat skinny dipping in Lake Ontario and playing an impromptu pop piano concert on the ferry ride home, but I digress.)

There we were, sitting in our little red Fiat and feeling homesick for Kensington Market and Queens Quay, and the thought occurred to us:

“We could just pull up tent stakes and move there.” Tally said. “We could marry Darq and just disappear and _be_ that weirdo who moved to Canada, if we wanted to be.”

“We have a job, though.”

“We could get a new job in Canada. Think about it! _Free healthcare._ Everyone you met made a point to mention it when you said you were from the states!”

I chuckled. “But there’s Chicago, too. Denis is there and he knows people.”

Denis was my college roommate, for reference. He also introduced me to D, so this is one of those butterfly effect moments that could have forever changed the trajectory of my life.

I knew I wasn’t going to convince Tally to go back to Indiana. We loved our friends there but after seeing what life in the big city could be like, we couldn’t waste another moment rotting in that town.

It was heads Toronto, tails Chicago: the only fair way to resolve the conflict in our system.

“American quarter or Canadian loonie?” I asked Tally. She was incredulous at first, I’ll give her that, but I pushed the question. “It’s the only fair way, Tally.”

“Loonie,” Tally said. “Can we put on ‘Heads Carolina, Tails California’ if we’re going to do this?”

“I’ll sing it for you,” I replied, and then hummed the tune while flipping the coin.

## Twi, 2021

All of my bravado, confidence, and ego went out the window the moment the Cats pulled up at the airport. It was one thing to talk to systems on the internet. Meeting a bunch of them in real  life was another thing entirely! I thought, briefly, about escape plans, but at this point I’d lost my driver’s license due to low vision, and getting the tickets would be expensive—

She rolled down the passenger window, leaned forward with her wispy, straight black hair, and yelled my name.

“Hey, Twi! Toss your bags in the back and let’s roll!”

…Yeah. she said _my_ name. I was right to be afraid of this one’s power.

“Excuse me?” I stammered. “How did you do that?”

The Cats flashed a big, warm smile. “You’re very easy to tell. And if you’re plural, it’s _really easy_ to tell your friends’ alters apart! Go ahead, try.”

I tossed my bags in the back to give myself some time to think. Sure enough, I could hear the sternness in her voice, the way her brow furrowed even when she smiled, the sharpness of her breath…

“Soli,” I said, and her smile only grew bigger. “Really? Okay. That’s, well, not what I was expecting. At all.”

“Why’s that?”

“I just wasn’t expecting it to be… uh, visible. Makes it hard to doubt the system’s existence.”

“Enjoy the validation,” Soli said, and then we sped off in her sporty little coupe toward Seattle, my new second home.

## Zoe, 2021

I was in a blue car zipping down a coastal highway. The sun told me it was early mid-day, but _I didn’t have my bags on me. Am I okay? Did someone take me? Oh god gosh I have to get—_

“Hey there!”

It was a lady’s voice, and one I recognized from Discord calls. The Cats! That means this is Seattle, and that means I’m safe. A knot in my stomach unwound.

“Oh!” I said, my face brightening a bit. “Sorry about that.”

“Don’t be sorry!” she said. “And don’t be embarrassed. This happens to people like us. It’s normal.”

“This is so weird.”

“Go On.”

“I remember waiting for the plane,” I said with a frown. “And now I’m just here.”

“Yep! That’s completely normal for you.” She reached for the console. “Let me play you something. There’s a DJ I like who has DID. Do you want to hear what one of their alters put together?”

She played a mashup album that was somewhere between too fast and too overwhelming, but as we adjusted to the overload the entire system sprang to attention to rock out to something I could only explain in the moment as “music for systems, by a system.” The music was nostalgic but new, as much of it’s sound was sampled from 90s video games and top 10 hits. I had a blast naming all the references as we zoomed around the sound.

Around us, the skyline of Seattle peeked out from behind a nearby hill, its skyscrapers long fingers on a hand that waved a welcoming “hello” to me as we sped toward our new second home.

## Sam, 2021

They - and by they, I mean Soli, and all the other cats, and her girlfriend Aimee - lived in a garden-level, one bedroom unit on Capitol Hill. For added “hip young people in the big city sitcom” cred, their apartment included a sliding window that functioned as a second entrance.

It reminded me of my own apartment in the 20s in all the best ways. A rotating cast of characters came through that sliding door; most of whom I already knew through long chats over Discord where we discussed everything from system life to transit proposals for far-off cities.

The most striking thing was all of them were just _there_, openly mentally ill and supporting one another. They talked about their challenges, and knew how to both accept and receive support when their turn came up.

And IDK, maybe that was what I needed. To be around others like me, to feel like I wasn’t a burden on my friends who didn’t have a crippling mental disability like DID. I needed a place where I could just be another messed-up individual among a community of likewise-messed up folk, and know that nothing bad was going to happen.

“We regularly break fire code here,” Soli joked. “Between my twenty, Aimee’s ten, your…” She paused. “However many you actually have in there.”

That caught me off guard and she read my facial experssion.

She chided me with a gentle wave of her hand. “I’ve had conversations with your alters, you dork. There’s stuff you don’t know yet, but I bet you will soon. You know why?”

“Why?”

“Because you’re going to let your guard down this vacation.”

Something about her tone of voice made me want to simultaneously obey her and refuse her. On one hand, how dare she just out and _say_ something like that, without considering all the possible angles?

And on the other, how did she say it in a way that made me feel safe and loved?

How did she turn what should have been an insult into an endearing way to say “I support you”?

Soli’s eyes crossed for a moment and her hands went limp. 
A switch. The voice that came out was still the one I remembered, but different. Gone was the confidence and husky alto. Instead, I was looking at a hyper-feminine trans woman living her absolute best life in gender euphoria.

Of course Lexi would come out to break the tension.

“Oh my gosh, you’re here!” She hugged me just as if we hadn’t ridden in the car together. And I guess, in a very real way, we didn’t; that ride belonged to Soli, Twi, and Zoe. Taking that dream logic into account made everything click into place.

The joy present in that room quickly pushed the thought away, though, as both myself and the Cats started rapid-switching to introduce themselves in person. By the time everyone had come up to say hello, we crashed onto the couch, stricken with the vertigo of being a dozen different people within the span of a minute.

There was a safe, cozy energy in the apartment as her cuddle-friendly friends slowly introduced themselves and joined us on the couch

An entire room of trans feminine women, denied their childhoods and raised on hard masculinity, were collectively regaining their ability to give and receive physical affection. There was something very… well, community-focused, obviously, about the whole moment. But it was intensely healing, too.

“Wanna teach me how to play pinball?”

“Thought you’d never ask,” I said, and the cuddle pile dissolved into a bunch of free trans radicals, all excited energy and no place to put it other than to run, run, hard and fast into something so joyful that it could cause our hearts to explode with joy.

## Addie, 2021

“You know we broke the fire code by coming here.”

It was Nebulosa making the joke this time. She’s another trans, lesbian system living on Capitol Hill. Here at Shorty’s, a divey joint near Pike Place Market, she wore her dark brown hair in a low ponytail to better emphasize her fashion choice of the day: a low-key starship fighter pilot uniform. (Which she pulled off *fabulously* by the way.)

She pointed to a sign about total occupancy that I pretended to be able to see. “Just there’s, like, so many alters among all these systems that we’re definitely over a 192 occupants.”

Chuckling at bad system jokes felt good. I hadn’t realized how much shame I felt about my own system experiences when I was back home. Maybe it’s because my friends remembered a different, more stable version of me, and I didn’t want them to feel burdened by this.

“So they do great hot dogs here,” Nebulousa continued. “I think they even do a Chicago style if you want a taste of home.

I looked to the menu of this Seattle dive, hoping I could read the text. No dice. However, something truly unexpected hung on that wall: a mustard-yellow Vienna Beef sign. My Chicago transplant-ass nearly fell out of the chair.

“You’re kidding.”

Lexi touched my shoulder with concern. “What’s wrong?”

Nebulosa looked nervous. “Something I said?”

“One second,” I said, and flagged the bartender down. “Hi. Do you do Chicago Handshakes?”

The bartender’s smile curled into a wicked grin.

“Twelve of those, please,” I said, smiling. “I got a lot of folks to induct to the club.”

“What’s that?” Nebulosa asked.

“It’s a Chicago thing,” I said, and left it at that. “So, you’re a system too?”

“Most of us here are.” We made our way over to a table to wait for the shots. Inside the plexiglass recess of the table was a dilapidated pinball playfield, and I idly traced my fingers along its surface, as if playing pinball in my head.

_They’re all just like me._

“Wild.” I took in the folks in the crowd surrounding me with a sense of awe. “I’m one of, like, two plurals I know in Chicago, and one of those I’m dating.”

Lexi popped her head over my shoulder. “We tend to find each other, you know. Smart kids. Outcasts. Weird kids. We build our own tribe. And it helps to be around other systems, but I can tell by the way you’re relaxing you already knew that.

“Did you want something to drink?”

“I bought a round for everyone,” I said, smiling. “As a thank-you.”

“You didn’t.”

Nebulosa looked at me, her new friend, with a mixture of scorn, curiosity, and concern.

I winked. “They had it. I’m required by Chicago law to do this. Act natural.”

Lexi shook her head. Nebulosa laughed. “Count me in,” she said, and bellied up to the bar to wait for her round.

It was at that point another trans woman made a point to say hello. She was close to my age, polite, and internet-poisoned in all the right ways for a degenerate like myself to love. She introduced herself as the Helixes, and we went through the whole handshake-and-share-system-names back and forth that is apparently standard operating procedure within plural communities.

I want to say that I was getting used to it, but the Helixes had me read for _filth._ She made a point of it, too: with one of her warm, calm hands she took my shoulder and gave it a squeeze.  I didn’t fight the touch and was rewarded with a friendly, gentle squeeze. “Gosh!” she said. “You’re wound up so so tight!

“You’re safe here, you know? Like, nobody is going to hurt you in Seattle. Nobody even *knows you*.”

She left to join the others and I’m not going to lie, it took some time to absorb and process that.

The drinks came out. For those of you who haven’t gone on the Chicago Handshake journey I won’t spoil it here; suffice it to say a great experience was had by all and everyone immediately ordered a second round.

I hissed as the liquor hit my stomach. Something about the burn of alcohol and the smell of cheap Old Style stirred something ancient within me.

There was wood paneling on the walls. Shag carpet dirty with sweat and feet. We were choking and could swear we heard laughter. Our body began to shake and the bar fell away. I wandered in a daze as the world around me gave way to overwhelming static and an animalistic urge to _run_

_It’s happening again. It’s happening and I have to run I have to lose them or else it’s gonna happen again and I don’t want it I don’t want it I don’t want it_

## Twi, 2021

“Come on. Keep breathing. You’re safe.”

I came to standing at street corner in the chilly late summer Seattle air. To my side was the Cats - Lexi, I thought - who had apparently followed me out. She dug around her purse with a quiet intensity. Downtown Seattle was, well, downtown on a weekday evening: empty, save for some bikers and cabbies returning from uptown fares.

“You back with me yet?”

The sound made me jump. “Lexi?”

“No, you dork. Your bud Soli.” A second look at the Cats’ face confirmed it; for all intents and purposes Lexi was really and truly Not there. If I tried to talk to Lexi about this conversation she would literally be at a loss to summarize what happened.

This fucking disorder, man.

“You know it’s me, then.”

“Like I said, you’re very easy to tell.” She plucked something from her purse and gave me a huge hug. “You doing okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“You just went wide-eyed and ran out of a bar. Here, have some system first aid.”

She revealed, pinched between her fingers, a fresh cone joint and a lighter.

“This is ‘Cheetah Piss Cookies.’ You’re gonna think I’m crazy, but I promise you it will help. You’ll thank me later.”

A joint. I was coming back from a flashback and her fix was sparking up a joint. I’m not going to lie, my first instinct was to say “how West-coast of you,” but I swallowed the joke for fear she’d go away.

The last thing I wanted was to be alone with my thoughts on that street corner.

I shrugged and opened my hand. “Fuck it. Let’s smoke this joint.”

She pulled the joint away as I grabbed for it. “You’re not allowed to stop until I tell you to.”

“The hell?”

“Trust me.” She lit the joint and passed it to me. “It’s gonna seem like a lot, I know.”

I could feel my heart pounding hard against my ribcage, as if it were trying to break free. “If you told me it’d help my nerves I’d stand on my head and do a gravity bong like back in college.”

“Good boy,” she said, winking. Fuck, she even knew what gender the alters were and changed her pronouns to match! “Now. Three good puffs.”

"That's a lot of puffs. You're sure?" I took a drag on the joint and willed it to work, to make the bad trailer park in my mind go away. Honestly, with the way I felt inside I'd have done anything Soli said to make the image disappear.

"One more," Soli said. "I promise. It seems like a lot but you need it right now."

I crushed half a joint on my own based on the advice of a twentysomething system I sort of had the hots for. I was 38 years old at the time.

This fucking disorder.

It took a few minutes before the weed worked its magic. The dirty, nasty room with wood paneling was still there, still nagging at the edge of my thoughts. That would never change. But at least now it was less overwhelming and nightmareish. I could put it away for now and it wouldn’t consume me.

"You're good now," Soli said. "Your shoulders just dropped a full inch from relaxing so hard."

I took a deep breath and found the energy to smile. "Wait, the world feels different now. Like, it's closer. Smaller. And if I touch a wall I don't have that weird feeling like I'm going to pass through it without making contact."

"That's called being grounded," Soli said with a smile. "You may not like to hear it, but you have severe trauma that affects your ability to function like a neurotypical human being. This stuff will help you when the symptoms get bad."

"Nothing we've been through was that bad. I mean, there are some unkind things, yes, and there's that big empty hole in my memory that I can't push through, but I'm okay. I'm not disabled or anything, and I certainly don't have trauma bad enough to warrant that kind of breakdown. It's obviously my fault."

Soli took my hand with a laugh and led me back toward the bar. "It isn't. And you have severe trauma; The others have told me."

"...oh, right."  

"Yeah, hard to remember things you're not the only one with control, ainnit?"  

I nodded. "It's so weird."

"The alters?" Soli shook her head. "No, that's normal for you. It's just an adjustment, is all."

"No, the weed I smoked. I don't feel high."

"Yeah," Soli said. "That's a good sign you needed it. Most people, they smoke weed and go from 'normal' to 'high.' People like us? Who use this to manage PTSD? We go from 'extremely triggered' to 'normal.'

"You get used to it, I promise. But for now, teach me some pinball, eh?"

## Addie, 2021

Shorty's was a crowded place at the best of times, but when it crowded with my kind of people, I felt at home.

The bar was built by a Chicago transplant who wanted to bring the Chicago dive to the west coast. The entire lot was cut in half by a dividing wall to suggest the thin, long lots Chicago is famous for. On one side was a bar, hot dog stand, and some fancy tables. On the other: pristine pinball machines, crowded into a tiny space, many of which I had never played before.

I was in my happy place to say the least, and as the hours passed turned back to my pre-system self, dancing between people and generally holding court like a 20's kid who finally found their crowd. Each of my new friends played a different machine and I'd observe them from the side, bringing up little tips and tricks as they drained balls. And to my delight, everyone seemed to have a good time. Some even got involved in their local league, which makes me ever so happy.

Happy. Not just a fleeting feeling anymore, happiness came with a sense of safety and belonging. Look, I get why the psych community doesn't want systems to talk to each other. We trigger each other super easily, and while we can take care of each other these episodes can have a chain-reaction effect, taking out every system in the room.

But here? Surrounded by systems who also survived the kinds of hell we survived? Screw the doctors. It was nice to be just another face in the crowd than being the craziest person in the group.

In a weird way, it was just nice to belong.

I felt a hand on my shoulder, and there was Lexi. (It didn't take me long to get used to reading the Cats the way they read me, turns out.) She wore concerned eyes and a huge grin.  

"Doing okay? Soli told me what happened."

"...right, Twi and the kiddo. You know, the strangest thing just happened. I had almost forgotten it."

"That gets better with time," she said, and then pointed to my squinting eyes. "Oh, Soli gave you the Cheetah Piss Cookies! Knew that weed would work for you. Honestly, any cookie strain is great for PTSD--"

"Hold on."

"And I'm having fun with pinball, too! I knew it was gonna be fun but it's so, so cool when you know what's going on?"

"No, it's weird. I feel fine. Happy, even! But I also know that I just ran out of this place like a wide-eyed, lost little child."

I turned to look at her with wide, confused eyes. "How do you deal with this day after day?"

Her eyes fluttered for a second and there was Soli again, eyes furrowed and stern. "First? The word you're looking for isn't 'like.' You _were_ a scared little child running out of a noisy, strange bar, in a very real and very inescapable way. The sooner you accept that, the easier this journey will be."

"And second?"

"Tell that dork Twi to stop ruminating on it. You're a system, and you're beautiful just the way y'all are.”

We played a few more rounds of pinball as the night grew long, but my head was somewhere else entirely. Not quite "anxious to make new friends," and not quite "surely these folks are going to hurt me eventually." It was something new entirely:

_Safety._  

The bar filled with the late night crowd and the crew decided to head home for the night. We got a bag of Dick’s and the whole dirty dozen of trans, poly, plural folk piled into the Cats' apartment. We stayed there and talked until dawn peeked over the country and painted Puget Sound with its early morning light.

## Sam, 2021

In the haze of dawn’s early light the crew headed to their homes. Meanwhile, I made myself busy getting comfortable on the couch for a good afternoon’s sleep.

“What are you doing?” Lexi asked.

“Sleeping, I thought.”

Lexi’s girlfriend Aimee laughed. “You’re welcome to join us if you want.”

So my girlfriends and I slept together that night. It’s no metaphor; we just cuddled and slept. And being there with them, knowing that my system was safe no matter what, I slept better than I had in a long while.

## Twi, 2021

Being away from home meant I could mess with my gender, too. Most days I in Chicago I didn’t get to dress up the way that I wanted to. Not as a person, but as an alter; a dapper dude and wannabe bartender. But here? Freed from any long-term consequences for my experimentation? You better believe I was going to go for guy mode.

That’s how I ended up in a soup dumpling joint with my new girlfriend Aimee, wearing a button-up, a binder, and the tiniest bit of beard shadow. Yes, the others had just spent the past 15 years trying to _not_ look like this. I wish I had an explanation for how that worked, but I’m just a guy. Sorry if that’s weird.

“How are you liking Seattle so far?”

Aimee posed the question. She had this cute smile when she asks it because she already knew the answer; I love it here. The people are weird, there’s lots of pinball, and everyone I’ve met has been an absolute treat.

“You don’t have to answer,” Aimee said with a wink.

“Oh, it’s nice! It’s got me thinking about moving.”

Look, we didn’t all want to end up in Chicago. We’re still over-the-moon happy here, but there’s a lot of fun in thinking about the what-may-have-beens. What would the system look like if Tally won the coin flip and we’d spent the past 15 years absorbing as much Canadiana as humanly possible? What if — oh gods — what if I never left Indiana?

But imagining life as a Seattlite if I were the only one driving the body? Sure, the resulting mess would have been life-ruining in the real world, but it was fun to run with my little version of the dream for a little while.

“Oh, there’s an apartment upstairs that’s for rent. You and D could move in.”

I remembered, in that moment, reading case studies about systems who ended up in a fugue state and, in that state, made some massive decisions. (I mean, “one way international flight” levels of big decisions.) I’ve run away from friends before without meaning to, only to come back wearing clothes I didn’t own before. Or there have been projects I’ve been told I did that I can’t remember doing.

Moments like this, where my heart literally filled to bursting with the desire to start a new life, made those wild, unbelievable stories of fugue state travel a little more believable. The last thing I needed to do was give into the impulse, so I laughed and waved the table off.

“I love the city and I want to visit, but I have a home and a wife in Chicago. And an entire found family!”

Amy’s friends’ eyes widened. “Oh, we were just messing around.”

“I know, I know.” I laughed and stuffed a shrimp roll in my face to buy some time. “Give us a second.”

Us. Yeah, we used plural language around strangers sometimes. Partially because we forget to mask and pretend to be a single person around others. Partially because here I knew there was no harm in messing up a new relationship because of my plurality.

I finished up the roll and started again. “So, one of the things about this condition is that I can’t remember what I did from day to day. In fact, I don’t even know what or who I want to be from moment to moment, because we all want different things. I love thinking about it, but I gotta keep the future bias in check, you know?

“I’ve made a great life for myself, and I want to make Seattle my, uh,” I counted on my fingers for effect, “third home, after Chicago and Toronto.”

Aimee lifted her martini and clinked it against my glass. “Couldn’t have said it better myself,” she said with a chuckle, and downed a good swig of the martini. 

She hissed as the alcohol burned its way down and we all shared a good laugh about the fact that I very nearly agreed to move here without even contacting my wife.

(Sorry, honey, things get weird in the moment!)

## Zoe, 2021

I was full of really good Chinese food and hanging out with my friend Rosie that night. She was part of Aimee but now that we’re not at the fancy Chinese place we get to be kids with each other and that was super nice.

We laid on the couch and held hands and whispered secrets to each other. “We can pretend it’s a sleepover,” Rosie said, and I was super excited to get out sleeping bags and popcorn but we didn’t have any.

Rosie told me some really sad things that happened to her, and I told her some sad things that happened to me. It felt good to share. I like sharing. It makes the bad stuff hurt your heart less.

(Around us, a small segment of the Seattle crew watched as the two of us acted like literal four year olds on the couch. “That’s Rosie and Zoe,” Lexi said to the others. “They’re both very little and want to be friends. I’m sure the adults will be back in a second.” I could have come up to explain that yes, I’ll be back in a second, but Zoe was having waaay too much fun to interrupt. -Addie)

“I’m glad I got a friend my age,” Rosie said. Our eyes met and there, caught in the twinkling of the eyes of a thirtysomething body being driven by a system kid, was glassy-eyed longing. We were in Seattle, sure, and we were adults. But in that moment it was just me and Rosie, hurt kids hoping to make friends!

So we linked pinkies and swore to be best friends forever.

“That’s good,” I said with a smile. “You’ll stay a while now. I can’t, uh, keep friends.”

“Aww.” She grabbed my hands and squeezed. “Well, you’re going to be nice and safe here I promise! There’s adults watching us so we can just be ourselves without worrying about it.”

“Promise?”

“Promise.” She squeezed my hands harder. “You’re safe here, Zoe. I double promise.”

I flashed a big smile. “Okay. Can we make music then?”

## Addie, 2021

I came to with the body already in motion, so I tried my best to be still and watch from a dissociated distance.

The system kids were kinds of like scared little bunnies in that way - if you showed the tiniest bit of interest in them, they were gone. But here, surrounded by new friends in a place that my old family and abusers couldn't get to? I could relax and let the kids do their thing.

I was on the Cats' large couch, holding hands with Aimee. There was this innocence in the way we made that contact, as if it were the first time we let someone in and it still felt so new and *exciting*  to everyone inside!

Sure enough, there she was making beats on Twi's little groovebox. He got it for our birthday a year or so back, "just to see if I like it," and now it goes everywhere we go. The thing with Zoe, though, was how effortless and *good*  she was at making music. Without so much as a hitch in her step her fingers slid across the lighted pads, and out came what she described as "house music for a trashy sushi bar."

It also made me feel terribly silly, realizing that an alter in my system knows how to make music as easily as one breathes and, try as I may, I wasn't allowed to access that power. So many little talents hiding in here, all held back by barriers meant to keep the bad stuff from destroying us.

“Just like how our planning ability goes to shit when you aren't in front,” Misty added.

No wonder we don't trust ourselves anymore. Who would, when what you're able to do depends on the day and the alter fronting?

"I think she's just excited to meet other littles," Lexi said. She was speaking with another plural we met in Seattle. The Helixes stopped by to say hello; we had plans to go out for a hike in a large forest preserve the next day. I guess she came over to hang out, but as soon as she saw the two littles on the couch she kept busy with Lexi.

We must have been a sight to see, with Rosie and Zoe playing like toddlers while the adults looked on, chuckling.

"Hi Helix!" Zoe said. She waved this big, silly, childlike wave.

"Hi Zoe-bo-bantha!" Alex replied. "Having fun?"

"Wait." The world snapped into focus and I shot up ramrod-straight. "Oh god, I'm so sorry. I must look like an idiot over here, pretending to be a kid--"

Lexi's eyes turned stern. "Addie! Hey! Zoe was taking her turn fronting."

"It's really rude to keep your littles down like that," Helix added. "They are just as real as the adult alters are, and they deserve to make safe decisions too."

"Yeah, that." Her voice turned back to sing-song: "Go back to making friends with Rosie, Zoe! The adults are just chatting. You're safe!"

That's all the more encouragement Zoe needed to pop back out. There was no discussion, no negotiation: one second I was in control and ashamed, and the next I was just, well, Zoe, 9 years old and feeling really safe. Something about being around other systems plus everyone being at the internet-strangers stage of making friends made me relax enough for her to take back control.

Potts put a hand on my shoulder. “Be proud of her. When is she going to have the chance to do this again, Addie? Play with another kid just like her? Relax. This is normal for people like us.”

Zoe's smile carved deep dimples onto my cheeks. The beat mutated under her fingers: first into a slow shuffle, then disco, until she was making etherial ambient patterns to twiddle parameter dials to.

Across the couch, Rosie watched the groovebox's lights dance to and fro. "That's neat. Did you know I played guitar?"

"No! We should jam out sometime!"

We listened in silence for a few moments more.

"You're gonna be a real good friend," Rosie said. It wasn't pointed at the system as a whole; in fact, I could already feel the memory slipping away in the moment.
  
Zoe’s face turned grim. "I'm terrified of when the rug gets pulled."

"What rug?"

"When you find out who I really am, of course." Zoe chuckled. "Once people do that they stop coming around."

Rosie's face fell. "There is no rug pull, friends."

"I just can't keep friends. I don't know why."

Rosie gave my hands a squeeze. "We're not going anywhere."

Zoe looked over to the adults in the room to make sure I saw them nodding in agreement.

## Addie, 2021

"Magic mushrooms just, like, *grow*  in Seattle. If you know what you're looking for you can just pick 'em."

Alex pointed out good patches for the shrooms as we walked through the cool air and beautiful vistas of the Seattle Arboretum. Wrens sang their wandering song overhead, and my footsteps released petrichor as we walked. Of _course_ magic mushrooms just grew here; what else could one expect from a place as weird as Seattle?

She walked the paths with a familiarity that we envied, honestly. To know a space so completely that every sight, every corner, every moment could be visualized as if going off some internal map. Me, I had my cane and was doing my best to tap along. It was still early, and I tripped on a few roots here and there, but I’d like to think I did a decent job navigating.

The first thing you notice about Helix is just how, well, *gender*  they all are. In the span of an hour you could see everything from hyperfemme diva to withdrawn shy boy, and every combination in between. We had talked about our trauma in broad strokes and decided it was better for both of us if we just left it at "we are way too similar to not have the same trauma.”

We stopped at the top of a hill that overlooked the sound. And me, autistic as usual, jumped right into it. “So. How's it feel to be in the 'mental health breakdown in your 30s' club?"

The Helixes laughed at that. “Right into it, then.”

“I’m just curious,” I said. “How did it go down for you?”

We walked down into a lightly forested ravine. Above, a plane approached SeaTac, its engine noise scattering the wrens for a good long spell.

“I found my system while I was working as a coder. And I was good at my job, too - I was the senior you called when you needed someone to fix a sticky technical solution. But finding out about the others made me realize why conventional therapy wasn’t working, so it was good at first!”

I nodded along. We walked around a bend that overlooked a deep valley and we paused there, looking out onto the grey horizon.

“It started with a lack of focus, I guess. Used to churn through code like it was no big thing, but as Covid went on I just… I just couldn’t anymore. Then there were the flashbacks, and the memory loss, and, well…”

They started to walk again.

“I asked for medical leave, they gave it to me. Then I kept finding more alters, and more alters, and fragments of things that used to be alters. Some days I don’t know which way is up. Some days I’m a kid trapped in a human body; others, I’m barely getting by without having more brain issues.”

I took a deep breath and hissed. Talking about it from the inside was one thing. Hearing it out of someone else’s mouth, and realizing that it applied to you? That’s a different thing entirely.

“I know your pain,” I said at last, and we kept walking.

“How about you?”

“Oh, I’m still employed, so that’s good. I’m really lucky to be remote right now so that I can work on getting the system under control and settled.”

“I take it it’s not going well?”

“To say the least.”

We walked in silence for a few moments more before I realized they were doing the same “stay quiet until you open up” trick I did earlier and honestly, *how dare they.* I managed a laugh in the quiet: “Guess I’m not getting out of talking about my problems, am I?”

“Nope!”

“Gah, okay. Fine. So yes, I have a job right now. It’s pretty nice, all told, and pays well. But I know I’m not as good at the job as I used to be. It’s the little things I keep missing. The meetings I forget. The balls I drop, you know? Stuff that should be easy but is insanely hard when you have coworkers in your head.”

Ahead, I could hear a runner approaching on the right. I stopped talking until she passed.

“So that's the hard part, I guess. I *know* I'm worse at my job than I was before. It's like... it's like I can remember *who*  I used to be, and what I used to be capable of, but for the life of me I can't recognize that person in myself right now."

"Like you were replaced?"

I considered that for a moment. "No. Like I'm broken. Like the person I was before can never exist again, because to do so would kill me.”

Helix nodded. “Same. It’s an adjustment, after spending your life being the high-flyer, isn’t it?”

“Yeah. I just know that the person that comes out of this,” I tapped my cane hard on the concrete for emphasis, “The, well, *we* that comes out of this will be different. Probably less flashy. Definitely less work-focused. More chill, for sure.”

“I don’t know who you are going to be, but I know you’re amazing right now. want a hug?”

I took it. Helixes give the best hugs.

“It’s funny,” I said, awkwardly trying to change the subject, “The more folks I meet here, the more I want to move here!”

“You can’t, sweetie.” She pointed to my cane. “There’s only a few walkable neighborhoods and transit isn’t advanced enough to cover for that. You’d be stuck at home all day.”

“Oh.”

“Sorry,” Helix said. “I didn’t mean for it to come off that way.”

I laughed it off as best I could. “You’re fine! Not like I’m going to *do* any of this; I have a home, a mortgage, and an amazing wife. I’m happy as a clam. But sometimes I like to, uh, look at how my life tree got pruned, you know?”

They took a seat on a nearby bench. “Tell me more.”

“I imagine growth in life kind of like pruning a tree. If you want branches in one place, you gotta prune back other spaces to encourage the growth. And like, as a kid you can grow in a million different ways, but every time you do you prune a little bit away from what could have been. Maybe those extra video games as kids means we won’t be piano prodigies. Get a BA, and you cut off an entire world of people you wouldn’t have otherwise met. You cut and cut and the tree grows the way you direct it, however twisted and gnarled it may become.

“Every time I come to, I realize someone else in my head has trimmed away branches.” I held up my cane. “Sometimes, I don’t get to make the call on which branch to cut, sure. But the mangled tree that came of me? with all its gnarls and whorls and stray branches? It’s a mess to look at.

“In Seattle, each of us inside gets to experiment with what could have been. Twi can be a dude; I can learn about mushrooms on a hike. Zoe gets to be, well, _Zoe_. Of course we want to stay here forever!”

“She’s a cutie,” Helix said with a shrug. “Can’t argue with that.”

“I just… yeah. I’m happy with how my tree ended up overall. Do I wish the others made different decisions? Yes. (I’d love to find out who tossed out our piano in 2013, for example.) But when I’m here, we can all be different people with different ways of *being alive* and honestly, it feels great. Would the illusion break if I had to do shit like ‘find a job’ and ‘figure out the whole ‘ope, now I gotta convince my wife to go to Seattle’ conversations? You bet! But this isn’t about being feasible. This is about trying on a new identity.

“That’s all, I guess. I’m just playing pretend for a while before I have to back to the real world.”

Helix put a hand on our shoulder and gave a squeeze. “Okay. Two things. One, *please* go see a massage therapist!” She squeezed again, hard, until my neck relaxed. “Seriously, you’re the tightest person I’ve ever met.”

“I bear my heart to you and that’s the first thing I get?” I chuckled. It had only been a few days knowing Helix but I feel like I have a long-lost sister in her. “You weirdo. ‘Sorry about the heartbreak and ennui and stuff but *girl get a massage*! You are catastrophically gay, girl.”

“Guilty!” she rolled her eyes. “Anyway. Right. This ‘new identity’ you’re experimenting with? It’s not a new thing. _This is what DID is_, friend. Never knowing who you are, or who you want to be, until you arrive on the scene and someone inside takes over. You have *always been this way*, Addie, and the sooner you accept that the sooner things will get better.”

I was speechless.

She patted my shoulder. “Now come on; let’s get you home. You wanted to hit the grocery store, right? I can drive you. Come on, slowpoke! Sun’s going down soon!”

## Potts, 2021

The Cats’ apartment filled with the smell of searing meat and roasting potatoes. I had headphones on so that I could listen to showtunes at full volume and mouth the words.

“What’s that smell?” Lexi asked, but I couldn’t hear. Aimee tapped my shoulder to get my attention.

I took off my headphones. “Oh! Sorry. Didn’t want to bother folks, but uh, what’s the point of cooking if you can’t sing and dance, I say.”

“You could put that on for everyone.” Lexi said.

“Yeah. But it’s Broadway today, and I know that’s not everyone’s cup of tea.”

Aimee agreed. “If you like it, we want to listen to it!”

“Okay, but I warn you, I’ve been singing for 30 years and I’m a total nerd about this stuff.” I pulled out my phone, worried over my music library, and threw “Being Alive” to their speakers.

“That didn’t answer my question, though. What’s all this?”

“Sunday dinner– wait, this part is so so good!” I pointed to the speaker and started singing along. “Sorry, this is a fun musical.”

Lexi laughed. “You’re fine!”

“Right. So, y’all made me feel so welcome and so seen as, well, a system. I wanted to do something to thank you, and the first thing that came to mind was sharing a family dinner. So:” I pointed to each pot, “pork tenderloin, roast potatoes, gravy, and a warm brussels sprouts salad.”

Aimee whistled. “Wow, what a spread!”

“Thanks!” I beamed. “Cooking is sort of my thing in the system. I picked it up as a hobby shortly after our family disowned us in ‘08. Mom never taught me to cook so I learned from who I could.” I spun back toward the tenderloin and gave it a flip. The sharp scent of roasted herbs and nutty butter perfumed the air.

“This is basically my childhood,” I said. (Well, I didn’t say it. A little teenage girl inside took my voice from me, but you know how that goes, &c &c.) “At my mom’s house we’d play music really loud and sing along. Mom made sure we got the notes right. And she cooked really nice Sunday roasts that we’d sit around and just, like, talk  about our day.”

“That sounds beautiful.”

“It was nice while it lasted.”

My eyes lowered as I thought about all the family dinners I’d missed over the years because my family simply could not  handle the fact I was trans, among other things.

Lexi pointed to the stereo. “It wasn’t all bad, was it? Now you’re showing us the things you love and that’s cool!”

“That’s what makes everything harder,” I responded. “I love  this vibe. Cooking, singing, chatting with new family? Can’t get any better. But I can’t help remembering what it used to be like, you know, when things were good.”

“And they weren’t always good.”

“Yeah. Help me with this, would you?” I held out a plastic bag to Lexi. “Just hold this open. I’m gonna sous vide the meat.”

“Sounds fancy.”

“My twist on family dinner,” I said with a smile.

The crew from Shorty’s trickled in as I cooked, each making their entrance via the half-height sliding door that functioned as a porch. Some gave me a huge hug, knowing that they wouldn’t see me after today. Others talked about the spread, the music, and video games. Always videogames, with some of these folks, and it suited them just fine!

We crowded around every table the apartment had to offer. Folks crowded around the dining room table, the sectional couch and coffee table, and even a few folks sat on the ground to share the meal. We sipped at wine from mason jars and mix-and-match glasses from the cupboard and told stories from our pasts.

Inside, we felt bubbly. Happy, even! Nobody from my past knew where I was, nobody could contact me unless I let them, and if I decided this was all to embarrassing to think about I could just delete the memory entirely. It felt, well, _freeing_ to have a chance to define myself again, free from any past in Chicago and everywhere else.

That anonymity was at the heart of everything, I think. Even this family dinner was, in a way, an anonymous way to gain family. Out here, nobody can see my mistakes. Out here, people could be held at arm’s length whenever I needed to. Out here, the people I met literally could never  hurt me; at the first sign of an issue I could just walk away, no harm done, back to my wife and family in Chicago.

Out here, surrounded by anonymity, I wasn’t afraid to open up.

When I was a little kid I had this love of costumes. I’d dress up in whatever fun costumes were around and play pretend for a while. Somewhere around elementary school, though, I fell in love with the idea of “invisible” costumes. Something to completely erase my personhood so that I was an empty shell of a person, ready to take on anything without my past failures being dredged up.

I mean, I grew up femme-presenting male in a small town in Indiana. The teasing was pretty overwhelming, and I learned quickly to never show my true self to the world. A town like that gives abusers eyes and ears everywhere, and the only safe solution to the problem was to invent a “false self” that people could fall in love with.

Somewhere along the way, I lost track of who I wanted to be, replaced instead with who I was *supposed* to be. Out here, freed from any expectations, I could reclaim that genuine self. And, if I wanted to, I could bring it home.

*I could let my found family in, if I wanted.*

We finished dinner in quiet contemplation. It was an old skill we learned growing up; be an active listener so you can’t get yelled at for spacing out, but every time you open your mouth you just so happen to deflect to someone else. I’m not proud of it, but we needed the space.

A fight was brewing inside.

“We could come here more often,” Zoe offered. Around us, the crew finished their dinner and busied themselves with doing up the dishes.

“Everyone’s really nice here,” Misty said.

“So is our family back home,” Addie offered. “We’re just so busy trying to show them we’re getting better than we didn’t even offer to let them in.”

“But here, we’re one of many, uh, manys. They get us.”

“Our family could get us,” I said, “if we let them in.”

And then we just fell out.

## Sam, 2021

One of the more embarrassing side effects of DID is the occasional child throwing a temper tantrum. When it happens I can only look on in horror, shame, and a little delight as a literal child cuddled tight to Alex and started to bawl.

Nobody reacted with shock. Indeed, everyone went about their business as if nothing was going on. Kids just have tantrums sometimes, and that’s part and parcel with being a system.

A child inside of me welled up to the surface. “I’m gonna miss Rosie!” they screamed, and then began to wail.

Helix took my hand and led me to a room for some privacy. “Hey sweetie! You’re safe! What’s up?”

“I got to be little with her and she’s so nice! And I’m gonna miss you too! And I’m gonna miss Shorty’s, and Lexi, and Aimee, and Nebulosa, and–“

“I know, I know kiddo. I bet it’s really scary, meeting new friends and not knowing when you’ll be back.”

I nodded. “A lot of my friends stopped coming around when I was growing up. It’s scary.”

“Can I promise you something?”

“Uh-huh?”

“I promise, the adults in your system are gonna bring you back! And I bet you there’s a whole mess of friends and family back home that would be happy seeing you being just the way you are!”

“Really?”

“Promise,” Helix said, and I made her pinky-swear on it.

## Addie, 2021

I came to back in the living room, my arms wrapped around Helix like one might handle a bit of driftwood after a shipwreck. My eyes were moist - again - and the room had gone quiet.

“Back to reality?” Helix asked.

“I think so.” I said. My brain felt like it was full of cotton. The world distorted in strange, dark tones, as if my brain were forcing itself to believe this was just an intense dream. After all, we don’t have little kids living inside our head who hold onto horrible, horrible things! That just can’t be possible.

But there I was, tears still wet on Helix’s shirt, and the evidence was unavoidable. “I’m sorry,” I said to everyone, but no one batted an eye.

“That’s just Tuesday,” Lexi said. “Last week I had a breakdown at an arcade with some friends. Like, full on breakdown. Screaming, crying, lost in trauma time.”

“Oh.”

“We’re used to this kind of stuff.” She waved to us from the door. “You don’t look okay. Can I get you off of the couch and onto the patio? I think you need some air and some grounding exercises to come back to reality.”

She was right; the world around me had the veneer of static. I was tired, despite being wide awake; a sure sign the switches weren’t going to end anytime soon. We even started to wonder if we were awake at all; that perhaps this whole trip happened in a single, disjointed dream.

So I let her take me by the hand and walk me into the chill Seattle nighttime air. The world snapped back into focus and I was back, visibly an adult and fully in control of my faculties. “Never gets old,” I said as I stretched and reminded myself that the body existed in real, three-dimensional space in 2022, not some dreamy dissociated soup of unreal past.

She lit up a joint. “You’re mad triggered,” she said, offering it to me.

Given the choice between ping-ponging between littles and adults all night and being stoned, I took the latter. A long drag later I could feel my muscles relax. The ground stopped feeling like it would give way at any moment and for the moment, I had control.

Inside, the kids needled at my consciousness. It felt like dozens - no, hundreds! - of little children were inside me, locked away in a vault, and the kids had finally broken containment. My skin quivered and my face went pale with terror.

I held up the joint. “So this should settle them?”

She laughed. “Oh, no. You’re gonna have a bad time tonight, probably. But at least with this we can say goodbye to everyone before you break down.”

I could feel the color draining from my body. “What do you mean?”

“Someone inside wants to tell their story tonight, and I think they’re done asking nicely.”

“I… wow. Okay.” I took a deep breath. “I don’t know if I’m ready for that.”

“I don’t think you have a choice,” Lexi said. “Breathe. That kid deserves to be heard. It’ll be easier if you give up control voluntarily.”

Nodding, I took a deep breath. Then my grip on reality was flushed down a long, thin pipe into the recesses of my conscience, unable to see, hear, or know what was talked about that night.


## Zoe, 2021 (CW CSA)

I started to choke.

I was on the couch with Lexi and I felt afraid. We tried to talk but words wouldn’t come; we breathed in tight, gulping breaths, as if trying to breathe around something large in our mouth.

And I knew, I just fucking _know_ what I’m remembering. The same way I know how to breathe, or how adults ask to keep secrets. Scents and sounds assault my brain: musk, maleness, Bounty fabric softener on the white sheets, my screams muffled in a pillow, my hips up and bucking as he plugged my butthole and I cried and I cried and

Gods, he raped me.

He raped me in the shower.

He raped me in the blue bedroom with white curtains.

He raped me in the master bedroom, while everyone else was away watching fireworks I was too afraid to watch.

He raped me in the trailer park and I screamed and nobody came to save me

he raped me

oh god no

## Tally, 2021

“Finally! I figured we’d get to you eventually.”

I came to lying on a stranger’s couch, my hands in hers. The cushion under my face was soaked in tears - more tears than I’d seen on under my eyes in my life. Despite that I felt nothing.

When I say nothing, to be clear, I mean “eerily calm.” I could turn off  panic by my will alone. Should I be concerned that I’m in an apartment I don’t recognize, around people I don’t remember, and crying? Probably. But I’m used to waking up in strange places.

I also needed to vomit for some odd reason, so that was new.

“What’s going on?”

“This is the tenth time you’ve asked that question,” Soli said. Soli! That meant I was at the Cats’ place, on their couch. In Seattle. Shit - was Addie late for a meeting? Best to wake her up and make sure—

“Let me get you some water. Sit up, please?”

Soli went to pull away but I lunged forward, despearte and childlike, to keep in contact. “Nono pwease don’t go pwease stay.”

The words came out hushed - almost a whisper - and with a heavy lisp. as if I couldn’t pronounce my “s” sounds all of a sudden. The horror of this dawned on me a moment later: I had speech therapy when I was in first and second grade.

*This system kid is stuck at six years old. My gods.*

“Can you breathe for me, sweetie?”

I tried my best to follow her breath but I felt a tickle at the back of my throat. “Stay with me,” Soli repeated, breathing in a slow, even pattern. I tried to match the cadence but my voice was vomiting forth something old, something ancient, something barely human.

What came out was a gut reaction, twisted over thirty years, that had grown into this mangled, barbed *thing* on the inside, and I could feel my memory burn with a truth I had forgotten for thirty-two years:

“Dwop it,” a tinny voice said from inside.

“Hi! Who are you—“

“No no nonono drop it drop it it’s not important drop it!”

“I know it’s a lot, sweetie. Breathe. You’re safe. It’s 2024; those people don’t know where you are.”

Then I was choking on nothing. 

“I told them he put his penis in me and they said I should drop it drop it you’ll forget anyway so dwop it.”

My body collapsed on itself for comfort. Soli tossed us a stuffie and we fell onto it like a life preserver at sea.

“Tally? You still there?”

Talking felt like a great effort; as if I was trying to control my body via an awkward remote. “Yeah. I don’t know this kid yet.”

“Does he have a name?”

“Dropper,” I said, not realizing the name would come out of my mouth. “He has memories of telling adults about being raped and locking himself in a bathroom for safety.”

“Holy shit.”

“Yeah, seriously.” A shudder passed over my body and I was the kid again, squeezing her hand ever harder. “Please don’t leave, Soli. Please, please, please!”

She flashed the kind of wide-eyed smile one might use to calm down a child. “I’m not going anywhere! Promise. Can I talk to Tally again? I just want to make sure you’re super safe sweetie!”

I floated somewhere between reality and unreality for a while, willing my body to listen to the commands I gave it. It took some doing before I could speak words again.

“Back,” I said. My brain was reacting to the constant switches by developing a massive headache. “Does this part ever get better?”

“Once you integrate, yes. But that requires orienting the others to the present.” She paused before asking the next question:

“How many of you are in there, anyways?”

I shot a shy smile. “You’ll tell them.”

“You have to tell the others eventually.”

“Fine.” I took a second and tallied with my fingers. “Four.”

“Four?” She laughed. “Yeah _right_. You’re definitely more than four. Fourteen parts? Forty parts?”

“Four hundred.”

A quiet unease filled the room.

“What happened to you?” Soli asked at last.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Apparently, I was supposed to drop it.”

## Twi, 2021

Was this the right way to do it? That’s for someone else to decide. But being around that many systems, in that close a proximity, for even a short period of time had me jumping headfirst into trauma processing.

Not that I had much of a choice in the matter; the kids made all the decisions that weekend. They decided to trust the Seattle crew. They opened up about their traumas because of that trust. And in many ways, knowing what happened was the first step to processing it. Even if it did leave me twitchy and chock-full of untreated PTSD symptoms.

I had no clue how this was going to shake out, but I trusted my gut. I felt relieved to know what was wrong with me, if not disgusted in what I learned. And I was talking to the other parts, finally. Things were supposed to start turning rosy from here, right?

…right?

I thought long and hard about this on the flight back to Chicago. Little did I know that this little system vacation was going to precipitate a complete change to my way of life, but for the moment I contented myself with memories of that big, safe space full of trans folk and plural systems who took in a broken Chicagoan trans girl and nursed her back to something resembling health.

## Twi, 2021

A week at compass comprised of twelve sessions of group therapy, five meditation sessions, and two individual sessions with a primary therapist. Ours was named Laurie, and let me tell you, she blew our mind near the end of the program. See, Laurie is an expert in dissociative disorders and child sexual abuse, and she was about to talk to Zoe without an adult present.

(…God, the strangeness of this never gets old. What in the world am I saying? “Without an adult present”? What does that even mean? No wonder I’m so fucked up—)

Addie, stop. Remember, Boundaries.

So I sat in group therapy, ready to name my emotions and my current mood level, when Laurie opened the door. We had planned this out earlier in the week after a really bad flashback; try as we might, the kids refused to talk unless the adults gave up the front entirely.

The idea terrified us. Zoe blocked us out completely whenever the flashbacks happened, as if trying to hold back a tidal wave on her own. Letting go of the relative security and safety of ignorance was, well, much like diving off a cliff and hoping the cove below had enough water to catch you.

Playing pretend at this disorder was fun while it lasted in Seattle. Sure, I pretended to be a kid back then because I got attention, obviously. But things are different now. there are *stakes*. We have to be certain that this system thing is real. That these memories aren’t, like, psychosis or hallucinations or smoking too much weed or something and—

And…

…And you know what, Addie, fine. You want to control the script, you write this part.

## Addie, 2021

I didn’t mean to—

…shit. Okay, I deserved that. Back when I was at Compass I wanted any excuse to avoid admitting the system existed. To say that I acted like a jerk to the system is an understatement.

Yes, I know this is silly. (We had even started writing this book at that point, so there was a *mountain* of evidence proving the system’s existence, but I digress.) But the one thing in this world I feared most was accepting Zoe’s truth.

If she wasn’t an alter, I was simply making up a tall tale about having a system.

If the system didn’t exist, the trauma wasn’t real.

If the trauma wasn’t real, the problem was completely internal, and therefore my fault. I’m hallucinating to get attention.

If I was hallucinating, I could continue to ignore that horrible things like that actually happen to People Like Me. It was destitute children from other countries being held in, I don’t know, a drug warehouse or something, someplace remote where I didn’t have to think about adults molesting children as a real, concrete thing that could happen to a person.

“Did you bring him?” Laurie asked. I jumped; the voices inside were so loud that I could barely hear her. But she stayed there in that moment with me, gentle voice and empathizing eyes, until I regrounded.

I pulled Jack-Jack from the backpack with a bit of a frown; a child inside was angry that we hadn’t let his head out of the pack so he could breathe. I heard a few heads turn as I cuddled the stuffie tight to my chest and followed Laurie to her office. The less I thought about what they were thinking, the better.

I imagined everyone staring at me at that moment, a plus-size woman in her late thirties clutching a stuffie and rocking with it like a child. They’d remember this, and I’d never live it down-

Right. Grounding. Exhaling, I released the stuffie from my bear hug and joined Laurie in the hallway.

“I’m nervous,” I said.

“Don’t worry. I prepared the space for her. Come inside.”

What was once a muted, dim therapy office with tastefully nerdy decorations had been transformed into a pediatric therapy room. Sensory jars filled with pink glitter and green slime tempted me from a side table. A pile of coloring books sat on an adjoining chair, complete with bright markers for coloring. I took a seat in the same chair I always chose and I swear to you, the chair was two sizes larger in that moment.

She readied her notepad and pen while I settled in.

“Nerves getting better?”

“A bit. Feeling silly, more than anything. But Misty keeps insisting I try. The alternative is more of, well, this *mess*.”

“Addie, I take it?”

“Ha,” I said, shaking my head in disbelief. “You’re good at that.”

“Addie, we’ve talked about this. It’s completely normal for systems to have little parts.”

“I know.” I picked up a sensory jar and twirled it. “And I’ve met them. They’re sweet. It’s just… I don’t like letting them out consciously, if that makes sense?”

She nodded. “Okay, Addie. Everything’s going to be okay. All of this is in the past and it can’t hurt you. The kid just wants to tell their story.”

“That’s not the hard part. It’s, uh,” my eyes darted to the floor.

“You’re safe.”

“I’m not used to uh, feeling little. Vulnerable. In need of protecting, you know? And especially around strangers, no offense.”

“This is what you came here for,” she reminded us. “To listen to them. To let their story be told. And you’re doing a really brave thing to listen to the others.”

“Yeah. Right, okay. Right.” I took a deep breath and tried to, well, blink out of existence. There wasn’t a good way to explain the sensation of trying to crawl out of your own body so that someone else could take control.

“You okay?”

“Uh, fine. Performance anxiety.” I could feel my cheeks flush with the childlike desire to play hard to get, to encourage an adult to see me and talk to me and make me feel safe.

I pursed my lips and concentrated. Nothing happened. I looked to her for a favor.

“Uh, it helps if you call her out.”

“Can I talk to Zoe?” Laurie asked, and I blacked out.
 

## Twi, 2021

Addie and I were cast out of consciousness and into a dark abyss.

We’re… nowhere, I guess. Picture a dead mall with the lights off. The smell of dust and musty piping filled the air. We were everywhere; we were nowhere; and in the core of it all was an angry, hissing *thing* that lived in the decrepit pit.

A dim projector played what looked like grainy home video against the white shutters of a closed store. In the image was a large church basement with wood paneling. Cameras and studio lights drowned the space in blindingly bright light and the air of an official studio.

A single figure stood behind the projector, shifty and shadowy. It was an angry pencil sketch that resembled a child, its face shifting and hissing with the flip of paper, the scratch of graphite, and sobbing. It shambled toward us with long, lurching steps, and when it opened its mouth a long, low hissing tone came forth to fill us with dread.

Above us I saw the real world, but it’s distorted. Like I was looking up through the thin skin of a drum and from there I could barely make out the therapist’s office. If I craned my ears I could hear the sound of a woman talking to what seems to be a small child. When I tried to scream out for help, though, nothing happened.

“The fuck is that?” Addie asked.

“It looks sharp and very, very painful,” I replied. “We should avoid it.”

The animated scribble continued its march toward us. The projector clicked through different scenes. Suburban home basement. A trailer by a creek. The church, again. Each image filled me with dread.

I could hear the scribble sharpening itself as it came closer, its jagged edges honed into light, tight, smooth-slicing killing machines. Addie scrambled for cover in panic, trying to find a weapon to defend herself.

I tried to be brave for the system. “Hey, we’re all friends here,” I started, but as I said that the scribble lashed out and left a long, then cut on my chin. I stumbled back and it lurched forward, sometimes at a crawl and sometimes at a dead sprint, its hissing now resembling a growling, a snarling, a cornered dog pockmarked with pustules and engorged ticks, its eyes alight with the will to live, its muscles giving out—

Lilith’s voice chirped in on the intercom. “Don’t run, you dummies. Remember what Laurie said: this can’t hurt you! Just listen, like we listened to you both!”

So I relaxed just like they taught me to do in therapy groups. Eyes closed, mind open, as the scared sketch charged at me with all its might, teeth bared, its eyes firmly affixed on the my jugular, and I leaned back so it could have a better shot at my throat.

“Do what you have to,” I said, and the sketch paused with its hashings brushing my neck.

## Zoe

The nice lady sat me down and gave me some markers. I got to color outside of the lines because I’m allowed to do that now and nobody yells at me for being a terrible artist.
 
Then I knocked over the markers and she got up and I thought I was gonna get hit so I balled up but she didn’t do that. Instead, she cooed kind words at me while she cleaned the markers from the floor.

“Accidents happen,” she said with a smile. “And that’s okay! Nobody’s gonna hurt you here.”

“Really?”  

“Not a one!” She smiled. “And nobody can get in here, either. Ask the others, they’ll tell you that you’re safe with me.”

I asked.

I got a warm fuzzy feeling so I let myself smile.

“I’m Zoe,” I said.

“I’m Laurie,” she responded in a sing-song voice. “Can you tell me more about what’s on your mind? I promise to keep a secret if you ask me to.”

“No I want them to know.”

“Is there a reason you haven’t told them yet?”

“I dunno. I was scared I’d hurt them. They didn’t like thinking about bad things.”

I kept coloring. I liked to color. Laurie had really really good markers too. So I colored for a bit and played the quiet game and Laurie gave me time to color and it was nice for a while. She told me I could play with any toy I wanted but she gave me a tiny little coloring book with fun animals in it, and I wanted to draw the bird in the middle of the book in super silly colors.

Laurie flipped a page on her notebook and pulled out a pen. “Okay kiddo. Tell me what happened.”

## Twi, 2021 (CW Intense CSA)

Around me, the mall gave way to liminal space. I sailed on a turbulent lake covered in liquid nitrogen. Then: a cosmic flush, a great gurgling sound that swallowed the dark, the dawn, the celestial bears. I smelled fresh corn silk perfumed with cow shit on late country nights. My non-body flowed with stardust and sewage through a black hole that pulled and pulled until my atoms gave way to Higgs bosons—

When the ride stopped I was looking at a living room from my past. I was visibly myself again, and for a moment I wasn’t sure if I was the cosmos or if I was Twi, witnessing something so horrendous that it had been locked away for 30 years.

I was staring into a living room where a man and a child were watching a movie. Someone had scribbled over the face of the man and the child in my memory. In fact, everything in the room, from the color of the sofa to the pile of the carpet, feels like it’s just… deleted from my memory. There’s a laserdisc player on top of a giant rear-projection TV. They’re watching, uh, a Disney movie I think. Something with a cat.

The scribble reappeared, waved, and took his place on the couch. Frosty glass separated us, giving the whole scene a veneer of unreality.

Addie reappeared by my side and we watched as the child waited patiently on the couch, alone.

“Want to know something weird?” Addie asked.

“Hit me.”

“I feel like I’m on the other side of this glass. Like, I know this memory isn’t mine, but I remember everything about it. The way his couch was really cozy, and how he had a big sound system and a laserdisc player. But here I am, sitting on the outside looking in.”

“It is our memory,” I corrected her.

“Yeah.” She looked away. “Just wanted to try avoiding it one more time.”

The scribble was joined by an adult on the couch. He sat close to the scribble, slung his arm around the scribble, and pointed to the TV. “Want to sit on my lap and watch a movie?”

“Yeah!”

The scribble, Addie, and myself all said it in unison. I felt like a puppet on strings as I was lifted up, up, high above the glassy amnesia wall, until I was in the living room myself.

“You here too?” Addie asked.

“I think so.”

“I don’t trust this.”

“We know it’s going to suck,” I said. If Addie and I weren’t in the same body I would have given her a hug. “But that’s going to have to be okay.”

We felt small in the moment. Excited to please the nice guy on the couch. He’s nice to me, and he spends lots of time showing me movies and playing games.

Sitting in his lap feet weird. He had a weird, uh, _thing_ that moved when I sat on him. I tried to sit on one of his legs instead of over the, uh, thing, but every time I do he puts me back right in the center.

“We can watch your favorite movie,” he whispered in my ear. It made me feel special and loved, even if the thing in his pants made me feel funny.

“Hey, let’s play pretend. You be a kitty, and I’ll give you lots and lots of pets! Sound fun?”

“Yeah! I like cats! Meow!” I mimicked the movements of a kitty, toddling on all fours and pretending to clean my face. He started petting me like a cat: first on my head and then back and belly and then his hands went down down down—

## Samantha, 2021

“Did he touch you?”

The others wanted me to think really, REALLY carefully before answering but i nodded. “Yeah. He touched me a lot.”

I kept coloring. Coloring meant I could answer honestly because the others were too busy paying attention to coloring in the lines and remembering things to stop me.

“Did you know the man?”

“Yeah.” I described him. “Moustache. Gray. He’s nice to me.”

“Was your father involved?”

And I wanted to say it then but you were all so scared and I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t

## Twi, 2021

The scenery changed faster and faster. A mall portrait studio. A suburban house. The mall, a trailer. My childhood bedroom. He, or someone like him, is always there. They use me like a toy while other guys watch and I don’t like it, I don’t like it—

Blink. I was eight years old and in my old elementary school. I had been called to the front office because 

Uncle J was picking me up that day for a fun field trip, just him and me. He can do that because he’s friends with the teachers and they trust him a lot.

“I just need to take him to a service appointment, miss.” He was lying through his teeth, I knew. Part of me was happy he got to pull me out whenever. And he’d take me out of school to do fun things sometimes. But I felt my stomach turn and a voice inside wanted to scream at the secretary to the nice lady in the front office “don’t don’t don’t please don’t make me go.”

I felt myself choking on a long, thick, member all the way down my throat.

The blurry memories kicked into clear focus. His hand on my lap in the car. The friends he shared me with. The house parties he took me to. The filmmakers—

No.

It wasn’t supposed to be me. It was Samantha. She was the one who had to live through it. This isn’t what we agreed on, everyone! We were supposed to learn about it, not live through it!

“We wanted to forget this for so, so long,” Lilith said. “I’m so sorry.”

I wanted to puke. I would have, had I any control of the body, but the scribble held me there, like was a puppy being shamed for an accident. It pushed my nose closer, closer, until the elementary school gave way to a church rectory late at night. There were men, cameras, and lighting there.

I laid on a shag rug in a church basement, surrounded by wood paneling, smoky yellow lights, and the off-gassing of drunk men. There were two little girls there with me. It doesn’t feel like me but every time I think that the sketch hisses harder and honestly I don’t want to tell it no. I’m not sure what it’s capable of.

The girls and I were on the carpet, and if I looked under the scribbles I can tell we’re—

No…We were naked, and touching each other.

The cameraman nodded at me. “Do it. Touch her. Show her a good time—“

## Samantha, 2021

I kept shaking and wanting to run but the nice lady keepr telling me that I was safe. Potts has to keep telling me where and when I am.

I did this to us. I was the one that knew I’d stop getting special treatment if I didn’t go along with it and I liked it, okay? I liked being special to someone. I knew it was wrong but I touched those little girls. I let those men have sex with me and I had a relationship with one of them because they were the nicest one and didn’t hurt us when he raped us.

I traded it all away because Uncle J loved me, and I wanted to make him happy so I could keep seeing him. I’m sorry I let everyone down…

*I was on my knees and I pretended to be a girl. There were men above me with thier penises in their hands and I’m supposed to bat at those like a little kitty who wants cream—“*

“There’s so so SO many kids in here, Laurie! They shattered into hundreds of pieces so that the adults could never, ever learn—“

*I watched a scared, naked young girl in a cage. In the back room, there was a girl screaming in pain and I can’t do anything about it because I’m going to be next and if I yell they hit me and make it hurt more—“*


“It’s too much!”

“It’s okay, sweetie. You don’t have to talk anymore. I’m proud of you.”

“I’m not in trouble, am I?”

I made sure Addie and Twi could see the sadness in Laurie’s eyes.

“You’re not in trouble, sweetie. You did great!”

## Misty, 2021

I was in Laurie's chair with no clue how I got there.

From the looks of her full notebook we had just wrapped up a session. Did I miss something? My head was foggy, as if I had just come back from a nap. I gave the room a quick once-over to retrace my steps and noticed the coloring book on my lap. Coloring book? I *hated* coloring!

I laughed - when I'm nervous and disoriented my first reaction is always to laugh - and tried to shift my weight around.
 
My muscles ached. I had gigantic knots in my shoulders from too much tension, stiffness in legs wound tighter than clock springs, and tears. So, so many tears.
 
Laurie handed me a slip of paper and a tissue box while I got my bearings.

"That was Samantha. She asked for some things during our session: markers, ice cream, and a marble run set. I promised her I'd hand the note to the adults when we were done talking."
 
"Wait. I thought we just started our session!"
 
"We've been here for 90 minutes, Misty. You probably don't remember."
 
"Sorry," I said on reflex. Sorry was my default state most days. Sorry to have taken up space, sorry to have bothered you, sorry to have taken time off work because couldn’t be trusted to not kill myself.

If anything, sorry was easier than admitting how crackers and crayons crazy I was in that moment. From the outside I must have looked absolutely looney: a grown woman brings a stuffed animal to group therapy, disappears into a room, and regresses into a literal child that colored and remembered and—
 
”Say thank you."

Laurie’s sharp voice pulled me back to the real world.

“What?”
 
“To Samantha,” she continued. “Thank her. Spoil her tonight. She’s very brave to have shown up today.”
 
I felt my heart race, my vision blur.

"It's okay. Stay here with me, okay? You're safe."
 
I took a deep breath and tried to stretch. I felt cool as a cucumber, despite experiencing feelings of intense terror and shock. I cycled through the two emotions so quickly that I got to feeling nauseous.

“Close your eyes, Misty. Breathe for me.”

I did. The room came into focus, though my stomach wasn’t settled. “I guess she told you a lot, by the look of that notebook."

“Do you want to know?”

“I have to,” I said after a hard swallow.
 
She leaned back into her chair and folded her hands in her lap. Silence. She adjusted her glasses, met my eye, and laid me low with the truth:

“Samantha remembers being taken from school to be raped by other adults. You were groomed, trained, and then used.”
 
My breath caught in my throat. Another chuckle. "Okay. So, pretty bad then."

She leaned closer to me. “What you did was not your fault and was never your fault. These groups survive by discretion. You're only invited in if you're known, vetted, and provide material. Videos, pictures, or in some cases, children to abuse."
 
"That's not possible."
 
"Samantha has no reason to lie."
 
"I just..."
 
"I know this is hard--"
 
"I don't remember any of this."
 
She sighed. “You know you have amnesia barriers, Misty.”

"Who did it?"
 
“Your uncle.”

A dozen fragmented images danced across my memory. Each one contained a flashbulb of a weekend with him: a trip to the arcade, then a night alone at his house, where we’d play games together—“

“Hey, Stay with me here. You’re safe. None of the people who hurt you know where you are right now.”

I picked up a sensory jar from the table beside me and gave it a shake and did some shape breathing. I hated this part of having DID; whenever we got overwhelmed we had to stop everything and ground. Made us like a fainting goat, sometimes.

“Back?”

“Yes,” I said. “Thank you.”

I kept breathing and counting seconds: in for two, hold for two, out for two. In, hold, out. I felt the panic in my head calm down.

“Did my parents know?"
 
Her face hardened.

"Probably. It would be extremely unlikely for something like this to happen without some signs appearing here and there. Many times, in situations like this, parents are in on it or know about it in some way or another.”

That’s all it took to get the tears rolling.

I started crying like I had never cried before. It felt like someone had shoved a shiv deep into my heart, and the tears bled forth until they became streams, streams into rivers. I imagined crying infinite tears into an endless ocean that covered everything it touched with filth, shame, and guilt.

Laurie just waited while I drained an ocean of pain, offering reassurance from her chair. “I’m so, so sorry for what happened to you. It's wrong and should never have happened. But you can care for those kids now. You can help them heal."
 
I heard the implied message under her kind, unoffensive words: "And if you want to get better, you're going to have to share your life with them.”

## Samantha, 2021

it was our uncle justy okay

he took me out of school sometimes he made me do house calls

and on weekends he took me to a rotating party where the adults would make me do awful things and they liked when i screamed

There i said it

happy now

## Addie, 2024

You know, in a way I was a perfect victim.

Neglected and abused by family to the point of being love-starved and desperate? Check. Dissociated to the point of forgetting where I was from time to time? Check.

And most importantly, I was literally blind to the men and women who raped me, so even if I did remember I couldn’t get a positive ID if I tried.

I hate his guts, but Uncle J was nothing if not smart. If you get one thing from this book, remember this: pedophile networks are filled with smart people who, above all else, _never want to be caught_.

And out in the sticks, where law enforcement is thin and social support networks are frayed, they could get away with almost anything their heart desired.

Fuck, man. We’ve been caged. Choked on dicks more times than we can count. Threatened with a knife to the throat to keep our rapists’ secrets safe. Hell, we were forced to film child porn with two girls, all of us naked and writhing on the shag carpet of a Sunday school classroom.

I wish I could remember their names, their faces, literally anything about them. Because we cared for each other, and we supported each other as the endless line of johns raped us without a care in the world, safe in the knowledge that they’d never be caught.

## Lilith, 2021

…Fuck, we almost wrote a heartfelt letter to Uncle J when he was on his deathbed. He died before I learned about the abuse, but still. Fuck! I would have been so pissed had my last words to him been “thank you so much for all that you did for me.”

Fuck pedophiles. I hope the afterlife is a thing so they can suffer for what they did to us.

## Twi, 2021

On the last day of Compass I had a discharge session with Laurie. We’d spent the past few weeks talking about what happened; namely, I kept trying to convince myself that this couldn’t have happened, and Laurie would calmly explain how wrong I was. Eventually I came to a grudging acceptance of what happened: my once-favorite uncle used his position and his standing in the community to sell my body for sex.

Mostly, I was angry. Angry that my “close” hometown allowed something like this to happen. Angry that nobody in my blood family believed me. Angry that I was almost 40 and had to spend the past three months of my life in therapy. Angry - and honestly, just sort of *sad* - that evil like this actually existed in the world, and that my disorder was incontrovertible proof of its existence.

Angry at the thought of child pornography existing with my body in it, that I was some creep’s spank bank material and nothing more-

I paused, and took a deep breath. “Sorry, Laurie,” I said, pointing to my head. “Noisy inside today.”

“You’re okay!

But something else brewed inside me, and on that final session I said the words out loud:

“Laurie, I don’t want to die anymore.”

She stopped taking notes for a moment to meet my eye. “What makes you say that?”

“I’ve always wanted to die,” I continued. “Never knew why. But now, I guess, I know what caused me to want that, and I know that this isn’t how I want to beat them.”

“Beat them?”

“Messy phrase, I guess. I’m thinking of narrative therapy here, and figuring out what this means to me. Did I get that right?”

“Pretty on point,” Laurie said.

“Before, I thought dying was the way to finally make them see my pain. That maybe if I killed myself my family would finally believe what I told them as a child. But now? Knowing what all those monsters did to me? Laurie, I don’t just want to live. I want to spite those fuckers. I want to fix my life. I want to have hobbies again. I want to feel joy, fun, love.”

“And your friends and family?”

“I’m still scared,” I admitted. “Opening up seems really scary. If they know things about my past, they can use those facts to hurt me.”

“Do you think they will?”

“It has happened in the past,” I replied. “With my transness, my blindness, my faith, my trauma. You name it, I’ve opened up about it and faced the wrath of my abusers. Even in Chicago stuff still finds its way to their home, and if I give them the chance they’ll get their claws into my new family and ruin it too.”

“Do you really think your friends would believe your parents over you? After all they’ve seen, and all they’ve experienced alongside you for the past ten years?”

“Honestly? No. They don’t care enough about me anymore to do cruelty. But the kids inside still think about it a lot. I… Well, *we* ruminate on it a lot.”

I looked to the ground. Laurie pointed her pen in my direction. “I appreciate the honesty,” she said.

My fingers traced idle circles in the therapy chair. “What if I tell people about this and they show up at my doorstep, demanding I change my story?”

“Have they ever?”

“No,” I admitted. Breathe. We’re not being chased by a tiger; we’re in a safe therapy room. Practice the skills. “I guess I worry. It’s one thing to say they were bad parents. But this? This is a lot, Laurie. Nuclear-level revelations.”

“Yes, they are. And you should be prepared for whatever they feel they need to do to protect themselves. Nobody wants to be painted as a child molester, Twi.”

“That makes sense.”

“I’ve worked on both sides of the bars on this,” she continued. “With victims and perpetrators both. And the perpetrators know the stakes. That’s why these rings are so well organized, and they know how to, well, ‘process’ a kid to make them easier to abuse without discovery.

“It’s a wicked business, and they ensure silence by demanding every new member bring material or kids so they also have skin in the game. But that’s all to say, the last thing your family will want to do is touch this history.”

I chuckled. “That’s kind of comforting, actually. Never thought I’d say that about CSA.”

“The tiniest silver lining! Right, I’m quoting that in your safety plan: ‘live for spite.’ What about the kids?”

“I’ll buy them more toys and make space for them to have their own experiences. It’s hard, and I feel really silly about doing it in front of others. But I’ll try.”

“Good.” She paused for a moment. “I want you to know, I’m *proud* of you. You’ve something extremely hard and should feel some pride for that.”

Having a safe, well, “adult” say that made the kids inside beam with pride.

“Thank you,” I said, holding back some tears. “It means a lot coming from you.”

## Lilith, 2025

Looking back, the silliest part of my suicide attempt is that we almost died over a bad karaoke song and too many McChickens.

No, seriously. We were working at one of those pre-pandemic tech startups that offered free booze and lots of activities in the office. One Thursday after work a bunch of us stayed at the office to get drunk and play karaoke.

We thought about leaving early to avoid the happy hour, but then people insisted that we have a drink, and one became two, two became four, and karaoke happened, and... well. You know. Drunk people order 200 bucks of McDonalds on the corporate card and ruin their diets to sate their drunk needs. If nothing else, the death poem would have been hilarious:

> > Too drunk and too sadened;
> > While my friends sing “Aladdin”
> > and eat McChicken,
> > In Lady Michigan my life will be stricken.

I almost killed myself over nothing. _Nothing_.

We aren’t proud of this. In fact, it may be one of the worst nights of our lives. But it’s the first time we knew that we wanted to live, and it’s the first time we talked to each other. So here we are, mentioning it in the book, because we promise you, this memoir is going to show warts and all.

# It Pays to Belong

## Addie, 2021, December 31, 11:55PM
The night I graduated from Compass was New Years’ Eve, and D and I were in no condition to celebrate.

They had recently undergone top surgery and were still recovering. (I think they still had the wound drains installed, actually!) My back was still killing me, so I laid on a yoga mat in the middle of our living room for the remainder of the night.

I fingered my graduation present for getting through Compass: a tiny necklace charm, chosen by the staff to reflect our journey. Ours was a small captain’s wheel, symbolizing that we were now in control of our destiny. (I still have it hanging over my desk, actually.) At the time the cheap little pewter charm meant more than, well, most anything in my life.

Around us, the house was in disarray. Our water heater blew out the day after Thanksgiving, flooding our entire kitchen. A demolition crew came through to save the house from water damage, but as a result we had a destroyed kitchen and were doing dishes in the bathroom sink.

Yeah, to say we were a mess is an understatement.

We sipped cheap champagne from plastic flutes we had purchased for a time when parties were still allowed and could still turn into a rager. Silence filled the room as the clock ticked toward midnight. We wanted to be sleeping, not pretending to enjoy a party.

“We need a vacation,” D said, and I couldn’t have possibly agreed more.

## Potts, 2017
Our family winter cabin vacations started as an escape from the rat race.

We were all in our early thirties at the time and the pressures of pre-pandemic office life were getting to us. Between going into the office every day, evening happy hours with work friends, and other little events that came up through the week, we were all exhausted.

We landed on a winter cabin vacation for two major reasons:

1. There were no good vacations between January and March, so we wanted to invent something to cut through the boredom.
2. This cabin had a fireplace and us city slickers were *determined* to have a raging fire going the whole time we were there.

Getting there required a seven hour drive and a walk down a snow-covered, icy hill. The end product, though, was a wooden hunting lodge with beautiful views of an ice-covered lake. The only thing ahead of us was four uninterrupted days to hang with our chosen family, with no internet, plenty of beers, and a mutual understanding that this vacation was about resting.

Over the past seven hours we had discussed gamifying the vacation, just to make sure we were inspired to relax. We awarded points for doing self-care and the highest score “won” the vacation. Look. We’re a whole gaggle of gay nerds, what else did you expect?

“So did we ever finalize out our point system for the cabin? I think naps are fifteen points, for sure. Doing legitimate self care is five points. If you do finish some big project, that’s like fifty points, right?”

Outside, it was so quiet that you could hear branches creaking a mile away. I could hear my heart pulsing, the wind whipping, and the soft crunch from a rabbit making tracks a few feet away.

Brandon busied himself with unloading firewood from the back of the SUV. “Those numbers sound good, D. The most important thing is that we rest and have a slow, fun, long weekend!”

The others handed me a case of beer and I started to make my way down the hill. It didn’t take long for me to find a patch of ice, though. My footing gave way, but I thought I could ride out the skid. You know, like a kid on a sled, except my sled would be my two useless boots.

That didn’t work out, of course, and a little pebble on the hill sent me flying. Beer cans flew everywhere and my back hit the ice with a satisfying “thud.” I could hear hissing as a few of the cans popped open, turning the fresh snow yellow.

A small part of me - something old, unknown, and terrified - jumped to the front, ready to take whatever abuse we were about to get. Growing up I was a clumsy kid because, well, *low vision*, and that usually led to long shouting matches whenever I broke things.

But here in the present, my family made sure I was okay. They took care of the rest of the hauling so that I could rest. Later, we even laughed about it.

Welcome to a scrapbook of the Arcades’ family vacation.

## Addie, 2021
“You’re only allowed to go down the hill once this year,” Brandon said. “No more accidents!”

I came prepared that year with crampons and a general understanding that the half-blind woman shouldn’t go up and down an icy hill more than absolutely necessary. This time, my job was to get the fire and ambience going while the others hauled things into the house. It made the space feel cozy immediately, which was great after a seven hour car trip.

The crampons did their work and this was the first year since our first time here that I got down without eating it on the ice. A sign, maybe, that things were going to go smooth this year. We felt so confident that the worst was behind us, now that Compass was out of the way. We planned hard for this vacation, too. Brought crayons Jack-Jack for the kids, music making stuff for Twi, games for the adults. We had a whole catalog of grounding strategies, a veritable bounty of thought interruption strategies, and a positive, forward-thinking attitude toward the trauma. Hanging out away from home for four days was going to be a breeze after all this therapy!

That year’s trip also happened a few months after I graduated from the PHP. I wore my little captain’s wheel charm close to my chest, and when I felt like I wasn’t good enough to get through this weekend without a flashback I’d tap it to remind me - us - of how far we’d come. That we could get through an entire weekend and have fun, no flashbacks, if we relied on our therapy skills.

We put on some Carole King on a bluetooth speaker for background music and set about my job of firemaking. Everyone inside my head agreed: we were going to have a great time. Some of the kids wanted to help with the fire so we talked them through building a basic fire. “You start with rumpled newspaper, then sticks, then a log or two. The paper lights the sticks, and the sticks light the log!”

Soon, we had a tiny fire going in the fireplace.

The second that smoke touched my nose, though, I knew I was going to fall out during this vacation. You just get a feel for these things, with time. Can’t control when they happen, but if you learn to look for the signs you can certainly get a flashback forecast.

D’s freezing hand touched my shoulder and the shock of the touch brought me back to my body. “Everything OK inside? You were just staring off into the distance there.”

I shook my head. “I was raped in a place just like this, once. Lakeside property and everything.”

They flashed a look of both sympathy and dismay. “Shit. I’m sorry hon. Are you gonna be okay?”

“I don’t know,” I lied. “No. It’s gonna be flashback town. I just… fuck, D. I didn’t want this to crash into my friends. I don’t want them to see me like this.”

“They all *love* you, hon. You will be fine.”

“I know. It’s hard to feel that, though.”

## Samantha, 2022 (TW CSA)

I opened my eyes and teleported to 1989.

There were adults in the other room playing cards. Their voices sounded like something warm and fuzzy, but the room smelled like beer and gin and smoke. When I smell those things the bad things are going to start happening. It started with the smell, then, the scent of his Seagrams mixed with the moustache as he leaned down to kiss me—

“They’re safe, little one.”

It was a voice I knew from inside my head but in the moment I had lightning in my veins. The man with the black moustache and the whiskey lived in a house like this one. I woke up there once, dazed and sore, after he did bad things to me.

Was I back there again? I couldn’t chance finding out. I was in a great room with no good lines for hiding. But if I went to the bathroom and was sneaky, I could slip out the front door and get help.

“You are alone in the woods with good friends, Samantha. Please calm down. You’re having a flashback!”

I really really wanted to run away. To run and run and find someone who could listen and I could just tell them, _tell them I’m being raped_, it could all be over. But the voice inside was gentle and told me I couldn’t do that. It’s feminine. Loving. Motherly.

“You can’t leave,” she said.

“I want to be alone.”

“Okay. we can do that, little one. Just a moment.”

The world went all fuzzy in that way that makes me want to forget the world. My body moved without me having to think about it, which was really weird. I felt like I was riding on my own shoulder and that was kind of fun.

“Going somewhere?” the boring adults asked.

“Getting a beer,” my voice said, but it wasn’t my voice because it was an adult. The others went back to their game and we slipped through the kitchen to an attached solar. It was dark and there were some hiding places there.

“Safety through obscurity,” Tally said. “You can hide in here if you want. You’re safe.”

I tucked in behind a chair just in case it really was 1989 and the bad man was still looking for me. And then I breathed really really shallow because I didn’t want anyone to hear my breath or give anything away. This never worked, but it gave me a little control over the when..

If you had time you could prepare. Cry a bit, try to get into the place where pain doesn’t hurt anymore and the world is a dull, grey haze. At least this way I’d hear his footsteps in the hall and have a few seconds to prepare.

“Has anyone seen Austen?”

There’s another voice in the other room that sounds familiar. Big friend D. They’re married to the adults in here and when I’m out they act like my big friend and get me stuffies and coloring books and stuff but anyway, yeah, that helped a little bit. They’d fight the bad man if he was here.

Today was a crying day but I had to be quiet because the adults were up and looking for me. I curled up into a tiny little ball and let the tears flow as quietly as I could. They’d find me soon enough, and they’d tell me to stop being a baby about it. But if I cried hard now, I wouldn’t cry when they saw me, and that helped a lot.

D said something else and sounded sad: “Oh god, they’re gone.”

A new voice. A man. Shivers run down my spine.

“I’ll check outside.”

This was it! I curled up tight and checked my sight lines and did my best to play dead. As a final touch I grabbed a quilt from a nearby rack and threw it over myself so I could pretend to be a pile of blankets.

The adults came into the solar once, twice. Each time they missed me. If I hid long enough I could sneak out later, when they were all sleeping. Then the bad man wouldn’t get me.

“Oh gods,” D said. “Last time this happened was the beach incident.”

“We’ll find them.”

I knew I was made when the third adult checked the solar. Our eyes met. In mine, he could see a raw, feral child, shirking from the light, trying desperately to not be seen.

D rushed in with a stuffie and the tears really started to flow. “I’m glad we found you, little one!”

“I’m so sorry,” I said in a shrill, childish voice.

D hugged me. “We’re all just glad you’re safe! Come on. It’s 2022 and we’re with our family at the cabin. Can you take some deep breaths for me? Come on. In, and out.”

I did what they wanted me to do and then fell apart. A dam inside me burst and the tears came out in long, gaping wails. “I wasn’t supposed to come out in front of friends.” I apologized, again and again and again so D wouldn’t be mad at me.

I didn’t want them to see this side of me. The mess. The inner child, terrified and alone, no longer able to care for herself. There was silence, maybe a bit of murmuring, in the other room. Someone inside reacted to the sound with intense shame.

“One of the bad men lived in a place like this.”

“Do you need to check and make sure he’s not here?”

I nodded. “I don’t wanna do it alone.”

“No, no, nonono!” they pet my hair. “Sweetie, I’ll be with you the whole time. I promise! If anyone’s there, I’ll fight ‘em.”

“And you’re a lawyer, so you’d win.”

“…in court!” They took my hand and gently led me to my feet. Familiar faces waited in the kitchen beside the solar, their worried eyes filling me with shame.

“This is Samantha, and she’s nine. She wants to make sure there are no bad men here. Is it okay if we search the house and make sure of that?”

There was a second where I thought the silence would stretch on forever. But no, it took only a moment for Brandon to reply. “Of course! Samantha’s welcome to check every room if she wants. I’m sorry you’re having a rough night. Would you like anything while you’re here?”

D nudged me. “The adults got you dino nuggies.”

“Those please,” I said. Brandon laughed and fiddled with the oven. D walked me around the entire house and there wasn’t a bad man there at all.

I ate a whole big plate of dino nuggies and said hi to the family. They were all really nice and totally got that I wasn’t an adult. And it felt good to just be out and not feel like the adults had to be ashamed of me.

Anyway goodbye now

## Addie, 2022

I came to with a full belly and tears streaming down my face. My entire body screamed with cramps and aches, as if I’d just spent the past hour terrified of the cabin—

Right. It’s DID. It’s _always_ DID getting in the way, isn’t it?

Phil saw me switching and grabbed my attention. “Hey there friend! Who’s up now?”

“Addie. I…” my voice trailed off. “Gosh. I didn’t want you all to see that. I’m so terribly sorry.”

“You’re fine,” Brandon said. “If it helps, this isn’t the worst flashback we’ve been around for.”

“Really?”

Mark chimed in. “Yeah, remember that you forget a lot of things friend!”

DID, man. This shit is a trip.

## Sam, 2023
Brandon, Phil, Mark, and D sat with around the fire with me, crossfaded, watching the sun set over the lake.

(And yes, I’m telling my part in the present tense if I want to, Twi. You should feel lucky I’m trying to help here anyways.)

“It’s funny.”

“What’s that?” Phil said. He sat on a wooden rocking chair, knitting in the dusk and firelight.

“That we can be published and have fans and all that.” The teacup in my hands radiated warmth, and its steamy wisps mixed with the smell of fresh wood smoke. I felt silly - no, I felt needy. That showing something beautiful I created is an overreach, a boundary break that I can never recover from if I bring it up.

But I’m trying to do better about it. Accepting that we’ve achieved things, that we’ve changed people’s lives, that we’ve _lived a consequential life_. And, most dangerous of all, that we should celebrate the achievements we’ve made in this life. That it’s okay to take pride in those accomplishments.

“So I got this letter a few months back.” I opened my computer and started searching. “Was on a platform I didn’t visit that often anymore. But I logged in to download some old files and there it was, this note in my mailbox from a fan. He read my book ten years ago, and took the time to find me and reach out after a reread a few months back.”

“You get fan mail?” Phil asked, incredulous.

“Here and there,” I said, not thinking about how that sentiment must look like on the outside. Fan mail? Hell, I was nominated for an Ursa Major award in high school. I’ve lost more fan mail than I can even count.

“I just didn’t really…, think about it, you know? That you’d get mail.”

“Yeah. I’ve been recognized at bars for my writing. Cons too. And I guess I have fanart hanging up in my house, too.

“I’ve had people tell me that my books changed the entire trajectory of their life. It’s an awesome responsibility.”

Phil shook his head. “Of course you would be that person.”

“Sorry. I don’t like to boast.”

“No, it’s beautiful!” he put down the knitting. “It’s just, I’m not surprised.”

Brandon chimed in from the other room: “I never expect you to have done everything, but I’m never surprised when you say you have done something.”

Laughing, I handed the laptop to Phil so he could read the letter. When he finished he handed the laptop back to me in silence.

“He has *headcanon*, Phil. *And he isn’t even the first one to have that.* Had I not looked at the mailbox I would have missed it entirely.”

He met eyes with me. That is one thing I really love about Phil; even though I can’t see it, he still manages to meet my eyes and make me feel seen.

“You changed that guy’s life,” he said.

“And I don’t remember writing the thing that changed his life. It’s like, like someone else wrote that book. It just *exists* without a creator. But there I am, reading this raw reminder that my writing has reach - has *power* - and I’m just thinking, ‘I don’t deserve this. Someone else made this happen.’ It bothers me.”

“Someone else did do that. In your head, that is.”

“Still. Fucking terrifying, to realize I have that kind of power inside of me.”

“And you use that power responsibly,” Phil said.

“Well, as responsible as a crazy, furry, queer lit writer can be.”

“The most responsible!” Phil said, raising his glass to toast.

## Twi, 2023

We were telling midnight tales around a roaring fire. Outside, the world is asleep save for the occasional snowmobiler buzzing by this corner of the lake. We were all crossfaded and in our feelings, talking about core fears and such, when I felt compelled to tell a story.

“So we’re walking around Gencon in Indianapolis, right? Big gaming con in my hometown. And some years, post-system discovery, that was a bad thing. You know, ghosts of my childhood hiding around every corner of this town. But the con itself’s super fun, worth a visit if you ever want to go. Anyway.

“I was wearing this silly catenby outfit that we jokingly called “A wizard sent their familiar to Bermuda as punishment but the catenby just turned it into a vacation” look, complete with overalls and a button-up and everything. It’s been, gosh. 8 years since I’ve transitioned and usually I can do this con without ever getting identified.

“But there I am, waiting outside the bathroom while D does their business, and this lady stops in front of me with this shocked face. ‘Austen?’ she asked, and then launched into a hug.

“I waggle my cane at her to be, well.” I pretend to wiggle a white cane in real life. “So when she let go I shout, ‘You gotta tell me who you are!’ and come to find out, she’s an old high school friend. Yet _I can’t remember her._ It’s like an itch you can never scratch, memory issues. But yes. Marion.

“I don’t know if I told y’all what all happened, but I’ve had some shit happen at this con. Mess, flashbacks, fallouts. Hell, Our mutual Craig still tells the story of the time I was exhausted and sleeping in the hall, and two moments later I was the loudest, most boistrous version of myself I could possibly be, as if a switch had flipped. Which, well. Obviously I know what that is now, but talk about forty foot tall burning letters screaming ‘YOU HAVE DID’, right?”

Phil nudged me. “Come on! Tell me about Marion.”

“Right. Well turns out she follows me on TikTok and knows about my transition and such. But she introduced me to her husband as ‘the smartest person she’s ever known.’ And I just think, that’s wild, right? Just saying that. Of course she’s met smarter people.”

“Actually…”

Brandon butted in. “We had this conversation yesterday,” he said with a laugh. “You’re stupid smart. Nobody here is surprised when you can just _do_ something none of us know how to do.

“And before you ask, because this is the next question on your queue, yes. We - the collective we, the queer fam - always know who is up. We just assume that you know we know.”

There were nods around the fire, and honestly that scared me a bit. It’s weird to be perceived, I guess.

## Addie 2023

On our way back from the cabin that year we stopped off  some small Wisconsin town near the Dells to wait out a snowstorm. Our attempt to get home was interrupted by a massive blizzard that would either have ended with a night at a hotel or our car in a ditch. I’m glad we chose the former.

To pass the time in the hotel room, Brandon and I chatted about work - or more specifically, the job market. I’d been hunting for a new gig for the past year, on and off, and getting no bites.

“It’s wild. I’m so used to just getting a job, you know? But i’ve had a dozen interviews and no hits. I actually think I’m getting _worse_ as I go about this.”

“That’s just imposter syndrome talking. I’m sure you’ll find something soon! Besides,” he added, leaning in for emphasis, “Didn’t you have that talk with workplace assistance? I’m sure your job will have to accommodate you in some way.”

“Yeah,” I said. “…yeah! It’s weird, though. Did I tell you what the company guy wanted to do?”

“No!”

“He wanted an appointment with my therapist to talk about my DID.” I shook my head. “I swear, I’ve never had an employer talk to my therapist in my entire life until this moment. I didn’t even realize it was a possibility! But yeah. He asked a lot less questions about vision and a lot more about more questions about the system thing, though.”

“That’s weird.”

“He said he’d never considered what was required for that before meeting me, so I’m helping him out a little bit. Which feels cool, I guess, if it helps another person going through this down the way.”

“When do you get news?”

“Monday, probably!”

“You’ll have to let me know how it goes,” he said, and we thought nothing more of it. We probably moved on to telling old work stories or something.

## Twi, 2023
### Why do you sign your pieces?
#### or: the “individuals vs. parts” question

I write this to you from a cozy cabin in Wisconsin. We’re surrounded by friends - family, really - and we’re simply enjoying each other’s company for the long weekend. Soon we’ll go back to Chicago, where we’ll learn what kind of accommodations our company is willing to offer for our eyes and our brain. I wanted to write this while we had a moment to reflect and process what’s happened.

The hill didn’t trip me up this year. Phil offered an arm and my white cane helped me check for ice patches. Inside, the fire roared and our friends stretched in front of it to relax muscles from a long car ride.

The thing is, this disorder kept on kicking the shit out of us.
Work only got harder. dates and deadlines started to slip. I’d spend most workdays staring at the screen, so overwhelmed at the sheer *volume* of work that my brain would just shut down. Or a kid would come out.

But we try to do things that make us happy, like writing.

As a system, preparing to write is like calming down a movie theater full of ten year olds. Can’t start the movie until everyone’s found a seat, settles down, and it’s quiet, after all! We’ve built up a system to get everyone settled in if we need to write something together. It’s one thing to write when you’re the only person in your head; it’s another thing entirely to draft a novel with hundreds of different people screaming in your ear. I would like to provide our ritual for that focus, free of charge, for any multiple who reads this:

First, there’s the Closing Of All Of The Tabs. Between Max and Twi’s coding, Samantha’s obsession with mechanical devices, Sam’s Amazon cart, and all the other wonderful interests you pick up along the way as a system, you end up with a lot of tabs.

“We should pick up juggling again!”

A child jumps up and down to get my attention. Lilith. She’s a sweetheart, even if she tries to be thorny about it. “We could do that, sweetie, but remember the rule about interrupting without permission?”

She scuffed her foot on the ground. “I have to go to the system chat and ask for time. I know.”

“Exactly.” I give her a quick pet on the head. “That get you what you need, girl?”

“…yeah.” Her eyes sparkled. “But you should keep this in the book. That way, anyone who reads it can be like, ‘hey, Arcades! you ever let Lilith do that juggling thing?’ And I’m guaranteed to juggle for life.”

“You know what? I’d absolutely do that with you, Lil! We could practice between meetings at work. Stand up and get active and all that!”

And… right. Where was I? Who was I? Am I still Twi? Nope, not Twi. Can’t remember the last hour of time passing, and apparently I’m doing some sort of freewrite for the book now?Fuck. It’s Potts.

Okay. I got this.

Potts here, taking whatever Twi had planned and doing it better:

A recipe for focus and writing
10 minutes | 1 serving

 1 | browser full of tabs
 3 | projects just sitting around
4-5 | video games the littles want to play
1 | playlist of music everyone can agree on

1. Close all the browser tabs. Save off things people want to remember into our notes.
2. Marvel at the number of silly little projects we start and how few of them ever get finished.
3. Negotiate with the system on post-writing activities. Add alter front scheduling to the calendar as necessary.
4. Repeat until mind calms.
5. Optional: Cannabis can be infused into the focus process for better flavor.

But yeah, Right. Give me a moment to look back.

Funny story how I got here, by the way. Twi made a gin and soda when drafting this section, and by that I mean he poured a single shot of gin, dissociated, and proceeded to clean our bong. Then, someone grabbed the gin, assumed we just wanted a shot for later, and came back upstairs. An hour later, though, I’m sitting here staring at this lonely shot of gin sitting on the counter, untouched.

But settling in for a group writing session, right! We wanted to uh, make an outline I think. Things that happened. Moments like this. Because the inside experience of system life is this incredible machinarium, full of fascinating conflicts and funny stories. We wrote this book to share our pain, but at the same time we want to show you the beauty of system life.

Yeah, it’s chaotic. Yeah, it’s screwed up. And yeah, this moment is going to come off as crazy to many, if not most people, who read this book. But I believe, deep in my heart, that the collective person on these pages is the only person I could have been in, the only way that it could have been, and instead of ending on the pain I want to show you the beauty and joy that come along with system life.

But when we sit down to write, and we’re all up and excited, everyone starts trying to write at once, and we end up with a manuscript that looks like it came from a serial killer or something…

Twi screamed from the back. “Don’t you dare pull out that ‘I’m too crazy’ crap, Addie. We’re not crazy. We’re different.”

My mind blanked for a moment. Eyes fluttered, vertigo swelled. Then I was Addie, in front and in full control.

I think I wrote some of those paragraphs above - no wonder Twi was upset with me!

Anyway, I wanted to laugh at Misty’s gallows humor but crap, sometimes we sit and wonder how it would sound if someone could peek in and hear our train of thoughts. What would they feel between us alters? Kindness? Hope? Anger? Would it scare them to see how differently another brain can work?

Would they pity us over how our plurality formed, or would they see the joy in this experience? We think about it, sometimes, when we experience the comfort of talking to other systems. Of long conversations about our headspaces, of noting switches, of how our alters relate internally, of being _seen_ and _validated_ and known as the individuals we are inside.

It had to be all of us that told this story, not just one alter talking about “the system.” Any one of us telling the story might have got it wrong otherwise.

## Addie, 2023


Two days after we wrote this we were severed from our job. (In reality, well, we were ‘not accommodateable,’ not given a say in the matter, and immediately placed into a process to find me a new job, but the news still stung.)

Despite all the change in our life, the universe still has its sense of comedic timing.

## Addie, 2023 (CW CSA)

For the system, this was a five alarm fire.

Threats to our financial safety hit hard and caused spirals. Oh, and getting emotionally raw like this let the trauma come out every single time.

It was 5PM on a Friday when things started spilling out. First it was tears: huge, sopping-wet tears that seemed to go on forever. D held me and I felt a twinge of embarrassment that I required this much handholding.

“It’s gonna be okay,” D kept saying, but the tears flowed and flowed.

“I’m not gonna get hired ever again!”

“That’s not true.” I know that, of course. We’ve bounced back from things before. But this is a full-on body slam to the ego. In the past there were no limits; I could get any job, do all the hard work, and still get up to grind it out the next day. Bumping into a hard ceiling at 38 laid us real low.

Then I was choking.

“What’s wrong?” D asked, but we couldn’t respond. The choking gave way to a different sensation: salty, metallic, sticky. _I am three feet tall and the big man groaned hard and then_

A cold hand touched the back of my neck and the world snapped back into focus. D started to rub, hard, to help me ground. “Come back to me,” they said, and I clung to the sensation of their hand on our back like an performer swinging on a high trapeze.

I looked to her with a look somewhere between terror and frustration. The taste was gone and I had no idea what just happened. Hell, even writing about this moment got me dissociated to the point of feeling pressure in my throat. In other words, it was a normal day in the system and we were processing another sense memory.

“The usual,” I said. “I’m back, I think. Mostly. Another one of the Bustle kids sharing.”

I pointed to my throat and gagged. No more words needed to be said.

“Makes sense,” they said. “I’m sorry.”

In that moment I realized how small I felt. It was hard to explain, this concept of “small.” It was feeling terrified and childlike, that the world was overwhelming and confusing. Sometimes the world even _feels_ bigger, as if I were watching the world through a child’s eyes.

I pulled away from D, wiped tears from my eyes, and tried to take a deep breath. Sobs racked my lungs as I tried to take in more air.

“Gods, D. The last time I fell apart it was bad. Real bad. I don’t know if I can survive it again.”

My mind rummaged through the attempt in 2019, the worst moments of Compass, of realizing that I was now officially “too crazy” for some jobs in this world, and nothing I could do would change that. No amount of backpedaling, lying, or pleading would put the toothpaste back into the tube: from here on in, I was… well. I was forever going to be the person with the white cane who _lost her fucking marbles_.

_I was broken, vulnerable, and unsalvageable._

I was disabled: truly, completely disabled, in a way that I will never come back from. I was vulnerable, and in many ways the world around me now had to give extra room and extra time to accommodate my deficiencies. And I saw the way people talked to D about my disabilities; ever since I started carrying that cane people talked to them about instead of asking directly.

I had to admit it: “No amount of lying or covering up could take me back to the person I used to be. I’m something new. Broken, but new.”

“I disagree.” D said, taking my hands. “In a way you never were before, the person sitting in front of me is you. The best version of you, because you stopped lying and started being honest.

“And we’re gonna get through this,” they said, putting their other hand on my knee. “Together. You have family now. It’s all going to be okay. I promise.”

“I believe you,” I said, voice still wavering with tears. “Just not in my heart. Not yet. It’s still hurting too bad.”

They hugged me. “I know, baby. I know. And I’ll keep telling you it until you believe it.”


## Twi, 2023
I’ve thought about killing myself once a day, every day, since I was eight.

This self destructive thought is like the bedrock of my personality; just an unending yearning for oblivion, for release, for this whole mess to be _over_. After a while the sadness turns to static and the terror turns to toothless daydreams. I’ve thought through asphyxiation, overdose, knives on the wrists, even suicide by cop; all in the name of making this deep, dark hole in my heart stop hurting.

And yet I’m still here, still struggling, still _living,_ despite everything. And happy, despite that tiny voice that pulls up my failures and suggests that not being alive would atone for my mistakes.

Honestly? DID plus suicidal ideation is a 0/10 experience, would not recommend.

## 2023, 2:30AM, my bathroom

It was 1:30 in the morning and I was sitting on the bathroom floor. Outside, my wife and friends were fast asleep after a long night of supporting me through my newest mental health breakdown.

By every measure I should have been happy, minus the whole “I don’t have a job right now” thing. (Even that wasn’t that big a deal; the company had a duty to place me somewhere in the organization because of ADA law.) Hence there was my manic ass, seated on a cold stone bathroom floor, counting votes.

The Emmengard System once wrote a comic for people who exprience suicidal ideation. It explores the various levels of ideation, from happiness at 0, to passive suicidality at 5, and “if I don’t get help immediately I will die” topping out the scale at 10. I was burying the needle in that scale that night.

“Addie?”

“Yea.”

My tears flowed.

“Sam?”

“Yea.”

The matter at hand is an old, old song for us. “Should we kill ourself?” It’s the same question we’ve been pondering since we were 10 and dissociated beyond all measure. We have so, so many subtle opinions on the subject, too: suicidal ideation has different flavors, different feelings, based on the day.

Today, I’m tired. 

“Twi?”

“I’m so so tired of system stuff, everyone. I don’t want to fight to be okay anymore. I vote yea.”

A deep breath of hope welled up within me. Is this the time we actually make this happen? Maybe this time we’d stop the cycle, do the world a favor, and just fucking _die_.

We brainstormed methods as we sat on the cold, polished stone floor. The thing about suicidal ideation is that after a while it becomes rote. Less existential terror, more “My god, can I raincheck on wanting to die until after I finish this game” exasperation with our suicidal ideation.

“Misty?”

“Yea,” she said. “Let’s be done with this.”

The only thing we wanted in that moment was oblivion. A twinge of nostalgia for the Old Dissociated Days bubbled up, when we could have just shoved all this mess down into the deeps of our memory to keep the party going. Those were the days; we could go so much harder and push so much further than we can now, tired husks we are today.

“Potts?”

“Abstain.” He shrugged in headspace. “What do you want me to say, that we’re going to be okay if we don’t go through with this? Sure, dying sucks. But not getting better? Gods. Who the fuck knows if we will _ever_ get better, you know?”

I let myself daydream about leaping from the roof of my condo building. It would take a minute, maybe two tops between slipping out of the house and sprinting to the edge of the building. Then a single jump, a terrifying three seconds, and splat. It’s over.

Just a few more yeas and this is all over. Thank fuck.

“Max?”

“Absolutely not.”

And just like that, suicide was off the table. “Unanimous decision” is a hard rule in our system when it comes to harming the body, as much as I’d prefer to have more freedom to end our life. But we swore to only do it if everyone said yes, and the votes were cast. I feel like I’m stuck in jury duty deliberation hell, with one contrarian holding up my only chance to rest.

But, like I said, the votes were cast and we weren’t going to die that night.

Sighs of relief and groans of frustration echoed in my brain. We were beyond exhausted, beyond fed up, beyond _any_ meaningful common sense explanation for our situation.

We started crying and gods, everyone, can we tell you how tired we are of crying? Crying about the past, crying about the adults that abused us, crying about existing. We wanted respite from the endless flashbacks; reprieve from the voices in the head.

We wanted the past to have never happened, and if that meant not existing, so be it.

But it wasn’t going to happen tonight, in any case, so we took the long, slow walk of shame from the bathroom back to the bed, where I laid and D wrapped their arms around me. From there it was just breathing, kindness. Gentleness.

“I love you.”

“Love you too.” A catch breath.

“I hit a ten today on the suicide scale.”

Their response was dreamy and mumbled. “What did you say?”

I paused.

“It’s nothing.” It felt horrible but the lie saved face. Better that D have a fantastic night’s sleep than worry about my personal health and well-being the whole night.

Sorry for lying to you, sweetie. It got really bad for a while there.


## Lilith, 2023

I was furious.

Our place was a mess. Our finances were spiraling out of control because we’re afraid to look at them. We’d dodged house chores for what, three years running, because someone abused me a bunch of years ago for not seeing the spots on the glasses? Because some guys used me for their own pleasure?

No. Not anymore. The line had to be drawn here. Either we figured out how to get better or we were going to die. There were no alternatives.

We had four weeks of paid time off, no responsibilities to speak of, and a soft guarantee of a new job when this is all over. I made the case to the system:

“Hey, we’re basically being handed a 30 day leave of absence here. This opportunity may never come again! Let’s try something before we end up dying: what if we tried this whole ‘healing’ thing we learned at Compass, but actually gave a shit this time?”

“You’d have to get Addie on board,” Sam said. “She’s melting down again. She’s stuck thinking in black and white; right now, she thinks she’s getting laid off.”

“She’s not the only one,” Twi said, but I shushed him.

“Look. It’s high time we have an intervention with Addie. Talk about our limits, and how they’re changing as we figure things out. And she needs to let us in.”

To my surprise, everyone agreed to the intervention. I guess when the alternative was a life spent fighting the desire to kill myself, a system can learn to team up real quick.

## Addie, 2023

When the recruiters stopped calling I knew I was deep in the shit.

For years, I was lucky enough to be in demand in my job. (We’re talking “can I take you to lunch to talk through this opportunity?” levels of cold calling, for reference here.) My work persona became more cavalier, more brash, and more open about myself at work.

One thing about us you should know is that we create art to process what’s going on inside our head. On one hand, no shit - therapy is expensive, writing is free - but this often didn’t jive well with maintaining an image on search and social networks.

For a while, it worked great! Being in tech in the teens was like wearing a suit of armor to the workplace; you could get laid off one day and have a job within a week if you flipped your LinkedIn to “looking for work.” In fact, the last four job hops I did were from a recruiter’s lead, and I came out of the exchange with a more prestigious job and a huge raise.

But that person? The one who was everyone’s top choice for a project manager when push came to shove? That’s not me anymore. I’m broken, and I need to temper my expectations.

“At least not right now,” Sam said. I could hear her voice in my head more often than not these days. It’s sort of pleasant, in a way; like you’re in a coffee shop full of your favorite people who keep you from doing self-deprecating things.

I may be a loon, and I may be a cripple, but I had plenty of friends in my head. So I got that going for me.

I spent the first two weeks of the reassignment process reaching out to my old connections. I hoped to rekindle some of that magic from the teens, when jobs were just shelf-ready staples you could get if you knew a thing or two about Javascript. My friends kept ears to the ground for me, but nothing really came up.

See, the market was terrible in late 2023 for tech. Everyone was busy unloading staff from their pandemic hiring sprees, and in the shuffle a bunch of talented developers and project managers were laid off, flooding the market with talent. For the first time since 2008 I was competing with hundreds, if not thousands of these talented people.

Talent, I’d note, that doesn’t have the baggage of a white cane or discussing mental illness in public. I’m not so naive as to think that wouldn’t be a factor in a competitive market. 

“Have we gone too far?” I asked inside.

I could hear Sam speaking over the din of Twi making electronic music. “Hey there, maybe we should take a break from drafting the novel. Get out of the house, maybe even take a shower?”

“I’m fine,” I said. “I haven’t sent my ten resumes yet.”

That was my self-assigned daily quota: find ten new jobs to apply to, create ten specialized versions of my resume, and apply to those jobs. I had to do that before I could do anything else, because if I didn’t do it off the bat the system would forget.

I had 20 days until unemployment. Twenty days.

Back in 2008, losing my job sucked, sure. But I was in my 20s, and my life was a lot more, let’s just say, _supple_ back then. Now? I had a mortgage to pay, cats to feed, and a wife to do good by.

“No. I’m serious, Sam. I think we went too far.”

“This is gonna be good,” Sam said. “Come on then, Addie. Tell me how we fucked up and will never get our life on track again.”

“Just… hey.”

Sam’s voice softened. “Sorry. That was mean. I wanted to try loosening you up, but, well—“

“You’re fine.”

“Phew!” I felt tension in my body release that I hadn’t realized was there.

“I just worry, Sam. All that weird art out there with our name on it. The blog posts from our 20s, books from our 30s, and those videos we did for the Plural Association. We’re an open book when we should have been clamped up tight.”

“Ah, there it is.”

“There _what_ is?”

“You’re the one that’s afraid of our art,” she continued. “I could bring you down here to see why we make it, if you want to.”

“You know I’ve tried. That’s why I’m writing the book; so I can get a glimpse of—“

“—What it looks like on the inside, yeah. Got that. Look.” She took a breath. “Gods, okay. Bear with me here.”

I laughed out loud. Outside of my head D and I sat on the couch. My laptop was on my lap and D was absorbed in a video game. They paused it as I laughed.

“You okay?”

“Yeah,” I replied, tapping on my head. “Just… every single time I sit down to write my parts for this memoir someone comes out and schools me.”

“What’s that?”

“Sam’s about to lay some truth on me,” I said.

“Oh, cool. Have fun with that, Addie. Do you need me to turn anything down?”

“No, I’m good. She’s right here with me even without meditating.”

“That’s progress!” D said.

“But I’m gonna go back inside and talk to her.”

“Have fun!”

“You back?” Sam asked.

“Yeah. D just wanted to check in.”

“We love her.”

“Always!” I imagined jabbing her on the shoulder just a little bit. “So go on then, ruin my day with whatever truth you’re about to rain down on me.”

“Listen. I want you to think deep about who you are.”

I laughed. “Impossible.”

“No, seriously. It’s time for this conversation. We’ve spent the past decade dedicating ourselves to our career. Why?”

“Job security paid for our transition. And this house. And, on top of that, I like my job.”

“Do you?”

“Well, I get paid a lot and I’m good at it, so yeah.”

“But imagine it.” Sam poked my chest. “Not today. Tomorrow. A month from now. A year from now. Hell, _ten years from now_. You’re still a scrummaster, still slinging software fifty to sixty hours a week. And the entire time, instead of working with us, you’d be _fighting_ us the whole way.”

“Work, family, money. Pick two. And we chose work and money. Kinda locked in.”

“We don’t have to keep it that way!” Sam stamped her foot. “I just… yeah. I never wanted the money, I guess. I just wanted to vibe with good, chill people.”

Another voice spoke up. “We could start publishing again, you know. We don’t need to make our living the only thing we live for.”

“We could make some room for family,” Potts said. “Our real family. Here. In Chicago.”

“We’re not asking you to give everything up,” Max said. “Just that maybe - just maybe - you need to pump the brakes a little.”

“Make room for us,” Lilith said. “That, or we’ll make room for ourselves.”

I felt their hands on my back as they all spoke in unison:

“Because when we’re all happy, we’ll all feel better, and that’s how the healing begins.”

Lilith dropped her guard, which shocked me. “Let us in, Addie. Let us help you get on with our life.”

## Misty, 2023

Look, other systems reading this. Lots of the tools the docs give you are useful. DBT kind of rocks. Trauma processing helps. You can pick and choose what parts work best for you.

But when they push meditation, don’t you DARE try to skimp on that.

Early in the reassignment process I had a day to myself in which I had no one in the house and no responsibilities to attend to. Instead of spending that time goofing off Lilith insisted we get back into the habit of talking inside, so we started doing two hours of meditation every day.

And, like, meditation is a loose term here. We’d meditate by doing whatever the system voted on doing next, and then doing that with intention. Maybe we’d spend an hour scrolling our phone, maybe we played piano for a while, maybe we threw on an album and let our eyes rest. But it was all done with intention, with full focus and everyone welcome at the front.

You can’t get there if you can’t talk, and you can’t talk if you don’t meditate.

Start small. Five minutes a day. Then grow it until you’re talking more and agreeing on things. Then y’all will get better. There: I just saved you a few thousand dollars therapy sessions. You’re welcome.

## Addie, 2023

We sat at a small, digital piano facing a window. Outside, I could see the swirl of whitecaps and hear the gentle rush of the surf. I took a breath and put my fingers on the keys.

“Gods, I don’t want to do this.”

It had been about a decade since I played the instrument. But freed from the confines of work stress, one of the alters inside had dragged our tinny little Casio from the closet and set up an impromptu music room in our dining room.

I pulsed a C major chord and took a deep breath. “I’m going to be so bad at it.”

“There are no wrong notes,” Sam said. “Remember what Roan said: it’s called ‘playing’ for a reason. Just let go and see what happens.”

“It’s so silly though. I am not in a music mood.”

“Trust me,” Sam said. I hated when I had to trust the alters. Usually it led to flashbacks, uncomfortable truths, and general discomfort. But try as I might, I couldn’t will myself to stand from the piano bench.

Sam was begging now.“You did meditation so well at Compass, Addie. All you have to do is relax. I promised you a magic trick, and I’ll deliver on it if you just trust a teensy bit more…”

“It’s just…” I groaned. “It’s just weird when I go away. Just blink, and two hours pass, with no memory of it inside.”

“That’s what we’re fixing, dear. Now play.”

The room filled with the sound of poorly played arpeggios as I searched for inspiration. I was, to say the least, a nervous piano player as a kid. In college I took four years of lessons punctuated with panic attacks, perfectionist impulses, and a general feeling of “eventually this will be fun.” Sitting back down to play reminded me of all those unhappy moments spent practicing things I _swore_ I knew already.

“Relax, Addie. Breathe. I want you to stop trying to move the body.”

“What in the world does that mean?”

“Uh, go limp.”

I went to let my body drop but nothing happened. Instead, my fingers continued to dance on the keys. The arpeggios turned into the bassline for “Stand By Me.”

“Freaking out yet?”

“Trying very hard not to,” I replied. “I don’t play piano this well.”

“You are right, you don’t. He does, though.”

I felt, at that moment, a child riding on my shoulders. He couldn’t have been older than eight, maybe nine, and loved to perform. I felt a shyness coming from him as my fingers followed his will.

“What’s your name, kid?”

“Schroder.”

“Like the Peanuts character?”

Schroder nodded. “Yeah. Peanuts are cool. I like playing piano.

“But I stopped playing because people thought I was showing off or they’d point out every wrong note and it wasn’t fun anymore. That and there was the guy who thought I played good and wanted a private concert in his bedroom, but there wasn’t a piano in there!”

I shuddered. Sam steadied me. “Gentle,” she said.

“I’m really sorry that happened to us, bud. Really am. But that’s all in the past, okay?”

“Can I keep playing?”

“As much as you want!” I said, and I felt myself falling down deep into the recesses of my mind as Schroder played on and on.

Then: I was back in the arcade, the sounds of buzzers, bells, and delighted children surrounding me. There must have been hundreds of them running around from the sounds of it! Above, a speaker piped Schroder’s performance throughout the space.

I could see nothing but blackness in that moment. I reached out, desperate to not be in the dark anymore. I felt a child take my hand.

The child spoke: “Oh, Addie, this is so interesting!”

“It’s not interesting, it’s scary as hell!”

“You can’t see a thing?”

I nodded. “Who is this?”

“It’s Max,” the child said. “And I think you’re blind here. You’re literally engaging in black and white thinking,” Max giggled.

She led me to a long, low-slung table. I heard familiar adult voices around me. Max tucked my chair into the table, skipped away, and returned with a rattling bunch of sticks. When she let them go the cane assembled itself with a satisfying series of snaps.

“So you can get around on your own,” Max said, and then took her place at the head of the table. “Okay. First system meeting with Addie in the inner world. Welcome!”

Polite applause hit my ears.

“Am I dreaming?”

Potts said, “Nope. This is just where we go when we’re not fronting.”

Above me, the piano continued to play. “That’s the real world I’m hearing, isn’t it?”

“Yep,” Twi said.

“Kid’s better than you.”

“Okay okay,” Potts said. “Kid’s probably got the stamina for ten minutes alone up front, so let’s get this meeting started. On my agenda: make sure everyone feels like they have an equal say in the life we life. Any other items?”

Sam knocked on the table, suddenly inspired. “Can I add ‘how do we even begin cleaning up after this three-year mental breakdown’ to the list?”

“Done.” Potts paused for a moment. “Addie?”

“Yeah. I’m okay.”

He laughed. “You very obviously aren’t. None of us are. What’s on your mind? This doesn’t work if you don’t share—”

“I don’t want to face patching everything up. From… well.”

I gestured around to the arcade I couldn’t see. “From finding this, I mean. We _lost it_ there.”

Sam giggled. “Not going to lie, we had a pretty cringey three years.”

“Yeah exactly. And furthermore-“ I paused and looked in Twi’s direction. “Sorry, I didn’t to butt in here. Let’s start with your agenda first.”

I could hear the smile in his voice. “No. You’re fine. Keep going!”

“Ok. So.” I took a deep breath and unloaded. “We fucked up our job real bad. We can’t make it a full weekend without having flashbacks. We’ve done _video presentations on our mental health_ that are publicly available. Every bit of advice we received on maintaining our career, we ignored. And now we’re going to pay for it.

“Not to mention the strain I put on everyone while going through this. I can’t even do basic tasks because of my vision, so they have to do so, so much for me. Not like there’s a card for ‘Sorry I found out I’m a system and fucked up our work product / relationship / plans (circle one)’ on Etsy for situations like this.”

“Sure, it was cringe. but do you regret it?”

“If we can’t get a job, yeah!”

“We’re artists, Addie. we _create_ and we _share_. that’s just the kind of people we are. That’s not going to change anytime soon. What’s the alternative - writing books that nobody reads?”

She made me think about the three novellas, four short stories, and two novels that were ready for publication if I only reached out to my publisher.

“We will find work, Addie. And we will clean up our mess of a life. Together, both internally and with the help _our_ family.”

She paused for emphasis there.

“I’m just terrified of what happens after that,” I said. “When we walk into an interview with a white cane. When we have PTSD breakdowns that force us to call off. I just…”

“Say it.”

“My safety net is being good at my job,” I said. “There. I said it. It’s the single most important thing to my world.”

“We know,” Sam said. Laughter drowned out the din of the arcade for a moment. “And that’s why we’re here, I think. To talk about how that’s going to change.”

“I didn’t agree to that.”

“There was a vote inside,” Sam said with a sinister tone. “We carry the majority. If it comes down to it, we can and will remove you as the host of the system.”

I laughed at that.

Sam grew cold. “This is not a laughing matter.”

“OK.”

“We have demands,” Sam said. “Shared hosting duties. Guaranteed time to do the things we want to do - including the kids.”

“You can’t be serious—“

“Including the kids! There’s no deal otherwise. You’re keeping them from fronting.”

“Because they act like children!”

“So? They’re _children._ Raise them right.” She hissed. “Okay. Moving on. Twi wants to take piano lessons with Schrroder. Max wants to redo our website. I want time to go out on dates.”

“I mean, that seems reasonable—”

“Dates with guys,” she continued. “Sorry, you didn’t let me finish.”

I shook my head. “No. We’re gay.”

“_You’re_ gay,” she corrected me. “I’m bi, and I deserve to explore that. Moving on.”

“We don’t have time for all of this.”

“Then we make time for this,” Sam continued. “I’m so sorry. this isn’t a negotiation. This is our path forward.”

“You didn’t include me!”

“You were busy doing host things,” Sam corrected me. “Going to work, meeting up with friends, applying to jobs. All you, Addie. And we appreciate that!

“But we have to slow down,” Sam continued. “At least for a while. Take the replacement job at the company. Do something that isn’t leader-focused. Let’s take a year to rest, recover, and learn how to be a good team together.”

“And that means making art again.”

Sam clapped. “Damn straight! We tried being small for so long, Addie. Shrinking ourselves into a safe little box where we couldn’t be hurt. But now? Now we’re safe. We’re secure. We have the space to grow.

“We spent the past decade trying to seem small, and look what it got us, Addie. Let’s try taking up space again. Like Tally used to.”

I laughed. “Don’t have much of a choice, do I?”

Nervous chuckles went around the table. Potts spoke up: “We’re not rejecting you, Addie. We want you along for the ride. Just… we have to have rules now. Boundaries. That’s all.”

“Okay,” I said. “And not because you have the winning hand. I’m tired, guys. And I need the hand.”

“We know,” Sam replied. “And we got you.”

## Potts, 2023

We made the time to heal.

We stopped playing as many video games and cut out some spaces that encouraged it. Not like we could play games forever anyway, what with our eyes getting worse and all. It was better to spend that energy on something that we could do blind: music.

Gods, we took so many music lessons. Voice, just to get our technique checked out after so many years not singing. Then Twi started playing piano, Max started with her electronic music. I studied cooking by improvisation, with mixed results. But the thing is, we started to _try_.

Addie still plays games, of course. We all do! But now, instead of it being our background noise it’s an intentional thing.

We came to an understanding of how the system was to work going forward:

- One alter is “on call” every week for situations where the system gets triggered. That alter is the default personality for their week on call, and if we are ever in trouble the on-call alter is in charge of getting us through it.
- Everyone in the system may have time if they ask for it. And we mean _everyone_. We’ve played with duplo legos and marble runs.
- If someone inside wants something and it’s at an impulse-buy price, we get it.
- Those impulses we experience aren’t random; they’re desires from the others.
- It’s much easier to ask what’s wrong inside than to try figuring it out on your own.
- We are powerful together. Always remember that.

So we spent the impromptu vacation shut in our apartment, trying to de-stress from the whole “oops, you’re no longer employed at your job effective immediately, please try something new” thing at work. We meditated. We followed the rules. Experimented with psych meds.

Anything and everything we could do to make sure we could never be laid this low again, we were willing to do.

With time and hard work things did get better. But word to the wise, if you ever get this diagnosis make sure you research your short-term disability benefits, because you’re probably gonna need ‘em.

## Twi, 2023

Then, just 20 days after the shock of a potential job loss, the panic about our career was over.

Turns out the reassignment process wasn’t a joke; we were moved to a project management position that had nothing to do with tech whatsoever. And you know what? Out of everything that’s happened so far this was the first time everything just fell into place for us.

There were no horrible memories dredged up by some unknown trigger. No anxiety about getting in trouble. One second I expected the sky to fall and the next, there was an entire community around me holding up the sky with whatever we have laying around.

It felt good to have folks go to bat for us.

I landed the perfect job that’s both challenging and full of kind people. We work less than we used to, which was good both for our eyes and for our brain.  Because we only have 10 or 15 years of useful vision left we were very particular in how we spent it.

Time, honestly, seemed to stretch out longer the more integrated we became. Work wasn’t an all-consuming thing anymore, with the fear of job loss hiding around every corner, which helped us relax. The big household chore triggers got better when I started accommodating myself with bright lights and latex gloves. And more we fell into our happy place, the less we wanted to escape to the internal Arcade.

Video games, once an obsession, started to feel like empty calories; why do that when where were a dozen other fun things to do in the moment? We started making more music, more stories, more _art_ to fill our life with joy, meaning, and purpose. It was electricity in the veins, gasoline in the gut; we spent the next year creating new things every day, reveling in the process of play without judgment.

But still, the boredom persisted.

From my experience as an addict, I could say the hardest part of adjusting to a moderate drinking lifestyle was the boredom. I’d say the same was true of us systems; as we integrated further and further, and folks stuck around for more time out in the real world, the longer time started to stretched. Days now dragged on like weeks; weeks, endless slogs that felt unending. Gone were the surprises of early system discovery, replaced by the drudgery of Monday morning meetings and arguing over gym schedules.

But now, when things went bad, we had the skills to deal with the boredom. We were playing music. Writing. Making time for good friends, and for our pursuits whatever they may become in the moment. We can find new joy in life, finally.

This really hit me while vacationing with friends at Rehoboth Beach. First day we were there, I decided I was going to do only the things I wanted to do, no matter what my vacation partners thought. So when we went to the beach, I turned down swimming. (you ever _smell_ an ocean, y’all?) I chose instead to laze on the beach and read a book. Nobody told me it was weird! They even thought I made the _right decision_, knowing that I was a weak swimmer and too blind to find shore alone!

So I was on this beach vacation, still getting paid, waiting for this new job to start. There’s nothing waiting at home for me, no stresses to return to, no responsibility. I read my book and sunbathed. Sometimes I’d make a stop by the boardwalk for window shopping, and that’s where I found myself face to face with a new opportunity.

This little store had a ukulele hanging in the window, and in that moment I wanted nothing more than to take that thing to the beach, no matter the price.

The guy inside saw me and waved me in. Without thinking, I greeted him with a smile and wave. “Gosh, I didn’t even _think_ to bring my ukulele to the beach. I’m glad you’re here!”

“You got a nice one?”

I pointed to the painted wooden ukes on the wall. “Yeah. One like that.”

“Oh, good thing you _didn’t_ bring it! That’s a concert ukulele. The beach would ruin it. Try this instead.”

I walked out with a blue plastic ukulele that apparently was the standard for surfers and outdoorsy people on the coast. My fingers hadn’t touched a string instrument in months - I winced at the feeling of strings turning my fingers to hamburger - but that wouldn’t stop me from trying.

You see, Rehoboth Beach was the basis of one of my favorite cartoons of all time - Steven Universe - and most of the catalogue was simple enough to be playable by even my out-of-practice self. My heart swelled with joy as I found my footing on the beach sands, and after a little assist from friends I was led to the shade of our friends’ rainbow umbrella, the sound of waves crashing into the howling laughter of the gulls around us. The beach was last-weekend-of-the-year levels of busy, and there were people all around me. In any other place I’d have stayed quiet for fear of getting yelled at.

In that moment, though, I pulled out the uke, reminded myself of the chords, and started picking at “Peace and Love on the Planet Earth” from Steven Universe. (Picking is a kindness compared to what I did with that ukulele; to say I’m a competent strings player would be, well, a huge lie.)	But I _played_. And when I stopped worrying what the world might think of me - us - arguing under our breath as we tried to remember fingering patterns - music started to come out.

Honestly, that hooked me. I’m a musician because _I play music_. There’s no amount of “good enough” I have to be to enjoy the fruits of my practice. Furthermore, _I can be good at this._

I played every day on that vacation. At nights we’d hang out for beers and a chat; I’d bring my electronic groove box to set the mood. We’d spend days at the beach and I’d pick at the uke until my fingers couldn’t stand it anymore.

We even found our way  to karaoke that vacation, where we gained video evidence of three different alters singing baritone, tenor, and second soprano decently well! Folks loved it, and even when I failed there was still a round of applause at the end of the song.

I came back from that month a changed person. The Arcades didn’t need the safety of the internal arcade anymore. We could create, and try, and risk things that aren’t just video games or other dissociation traps.

We could live a good life, if we chose it. And we did.


## Addie, 2024

It could have been so much worse.

My extensive white collar career meant I had savings on hand. My government attorney wife had excellent mental health care coverage, so I was able to get therapy twice a week as I worked through the worst of it. I paid three figures for treatment at Compass after insurance did its thing. I was also a passing, white trans woman who could disappear into the background whenever she needed to, which lets me go most anywhere without getting harassed by transphobes.

So, so many things landed in my favor. If any one of those things hadn’t have happened, I’d be dead by now.

Never let it be said I’m not one lucky sonofabitch. Hardworking? Sure. But undeniably lucky for sure.

## Lilith, 2023


I dream, sometimes, about them showing up at our door. My family, that is.

It’s one of those obsessive thoughts I can never fully put to bed; that maybe five or ten years from now they’ll show back up in my life like nothing happened. They live on in my dreams as antagonists, nightmares, and leeches: why wouldn’t they make an appearance in the real world as well?

Besides, I would not be the first person they tried to hoover back up after a discard. Doesn’t matter how hurt someone may have been, time “heals all wounds.” But that’s bullshit. Effort, apologies, and a commitment to change heal wounds. Letting them lie just makes them fester, swell, and hurt.

I tried for years to tell them how much I was hurt: first with stories they rarely read, then with direct conversations that turned into long, meandering discussions about how I was simply wrong. Twice in my life I dropped all pretense to pride and reached out, desperate for support and for the family to fulfill its role once. Each time, my pain went ignored.

There’s a very famous piece in estrangement forums called the “missing missing reasons.” You can read it for yourself if you want, but the crux of the argument is this: abusive people ignore when their targets feel hurt, and when later confronted with evidence of their actions they will conveniently “forget” that the abuse never happened. “Tell me what I did wrong!” seems like a reasonable question, of course, if you ignore the dozens and dozens of times I made my point perfectly clear.

(The point, of course, is to fish for inconsistencies. They’ll then jump on that inconsistency instead of engaging with what their target actually feels, since doing that would require admitting wrongdoing on both sides, but I digress.)

I changed my number because I couldn’t get the nightmare of them contacting me out of my mind. Hell, I’m so controlled by thoughts of this past that I’m writing a fucking _memoir_ about the abuse I experienced. If that doesn’t hint at some big, burning-red-flag missing reasons for my estrangement with my parents, I don’t know what does.

## Potts, 2023

This morning, when I sat down to write my thousand words, I had a clear picture of how the nightmare scenario with my family could go. Not that it will _ever_ come to pass - I’ve been in Chicago for 15 years without a single visit from them - but I’d rather prepare out of an abundance of caution than be caught flat-footed by them.

Besides, I’m sure some of them will thumb through the book to see what I say about them, so chances are good I have the right audience for it.

The scenario my brain tries to scare me with is this: my family shows up to my condo. They sweet-talk their way into the building. They could then enter my condo, corner me, and I’d be back in the shit. But again, that’s just a fantasy meant to scare us. _It wasn’t based in reality._

So if anyone mentioned in this novel has considered some intervention like this… this is how it would go.

Family, I have obsessed over how to say this to you for thirty-five years. After all that navel-gazing, I can encompass the entirety of my hurt, all of my hurt and confusion, with a thirty second speech:

"First and foremost, this is an official notice of trespass. Don’t come to my house again. But since you’re already here: listen. If your God himself came to my bedroom in a bolt of lightning and demanded that I ‘honor my kin’ or face eternal torment, I’m going to develop a taste for brimstone. You had a chance to be a family. You decided to not honor that for me. These are the consequences for those actions. I would now rather suffer eternal torment than be forced to have a conversation with the people who hurt me. Have a good day. Ta!"

Why in the _world_ would I allow folks in my life who treated me as badly as they had?

## Twi, 2024

I’m not proud to say this but I kept expecting things to go badly.

Maybe the job fell through. Maybe I ended up hating my new coworkers. But no, the new job was wonderfully human-focused and my coworkers are absolute gems!

Maybe I’d get tired of the piano stuff. And sure, that could have happened. But in playing we found a new favorite thing to do, and have been on cloud nine with our sessions at the piano ever since.

I kept going to my therapy appointments, trying to dig up some new mound of crap to work through. But nothing came. It felt anticlimactic; after years of swinging at this mess, 

If I’m being honest, I started dreading therapy.

You ever spend 45 minutes making small talk with someone who literally knows every horrible thing you’ve ever been through? Yeah. It’s, uh, an awkward but lovely experience. On one hand, you’re happy to be healed to the point that there’s nothing left to talk about. On the other, 45 minutes is a _lot_ of small talk.

“I think we can graduate down to one session a week,” Joey said.

“Really?”

“You feel stable, don’t you?”

The realization hit me like a truck. It’d been months since we thought about dying, and weeks since we started being actively afraid of suicide. My brain, once a blanket of static fuzz and sudden loud noises, slowed down to reality’s pace. And if you sat me down, right there and then, and tested my memory about the last three days, I’d be able to tell you everything I did. (Sure, it’d take a bit longer than most folks and I’d probably argue out loud at myself, but believe me, we’d _remember the shit out of those days_.)

After three years of cycling between slightly better, getting clobbered by trauma, and struggling to stay stable, here we were on the other side. Tangible progress. After three years of feeling genuinely insane, here we were, suddenly calm and happy. (Still insane, I guess, but it doesn’t feel so bad anymore.)

After three years of hard work on unbelieveable events, disability, and my career falling apart, I was finally just another boring person. 

Another boring person with some dreams they gave up on, but still makes art. The kind of boring person who can smile at you and go about their day. The kind of person who sometimes gets a chance to change peoples’ lives through the acts they do on this Earth, and then does it because that’s a thing we want to see happen in this world.

Lordy, I’m normal. Fucking finally.


## Potts, 2024

Going through a deep, milestone moment is sort of, well, disappointing.

Like, deep down, right in the heart of hearts, we feel like we’re shedding a chrysalis and emerging as a newfound, completely changed self. We want there to be birds singing, credits rolling, something to show for this backslope of Frytag’s Triangle. Yet the days keep going on, turning to months, months to years.

On the outside, it’s Tuesday.

Ever see that movie clip from Street Fighter? (Raul Julia hams it up as the evil dictator Bison, by the way. Watch the film for that alone.) So Chun-Li is telling Bison how his murderous rampages uprooted her entire life, upended her home, and destroyed her people. In response, Bison (who is exchanging his OUTDOOR HAT for his INDOOR HAT at this time and guys, again, I can’t emphasize enough how much trashy, campy goodness this movie is) replies: “I’m sorry, I don’t remember it.”

“For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.”

And honestly, this is the mantra of trauma processing, and why going through it sucks so much. The abusers don’t remember (It’s a Tuesday.) Your mental health isn’t exactly anyone else’s problem (again, Tuesday) unless your actions make it one. And the time you start healing, when you want to scream out to the heavens “HEY LOOK AT ME, I’M HAVING A MAJOR LIFE EVENT RIGHT NOW”?

Yep, Tuesday.

Sure, when you’re falling apart, everyone dotes on you. Who wouldn’t want to help their family, their friends, or their tribe out? So everyone changes their behavior to make you feel better. But as you get better, as your sense of security goes up, and when you’re no longer in visible pain? You’re no longer needing that extra level of care, and it fades. (And yes, this is good! We give and take energy from each other in times of need!) The healing side is harder to celebrate, though.

For you, the day you healed was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.



## Twi, 2024
While drafting this I got a notification that members of r/Blind were getting together for a little chat. I thought about taking a pause to join, but Addie stopped me. “We’re not ready for that yet,” she said, head shaking. I felt her anxiety bubbling over into me.

I closed the chat. “Of course, Addie. Take your time.”

Saying we got some things solved isn’t to say we solved everything. But dang, if the only thing I have to deal with from here on in is occasionally being scared to admit I’m going blind, that’s small potatoes compared to what we conquered before!

For the first time, we’re not scared to enjoy our life. Maybe we don’t always agree on what that means, but we listen, and we try, and we hope. Maybe the trying’s half the fun, and if we fail the world will still be stable.

So yeah, sometimes your midlife crisis involves mourning lost time, sometimes it involves admitting to yourself that your uncle trafficked you for sex with men in your town. Tomato, Tomahto. How was your day?



## Addie, 2024

The memoirs ended not with a bang, but a whimper of calm, stable joy. The flashbacks got shorter, the switches smoother. We became more aware of our body and the passage of time, to a point that we started getting bored with all the spare time we had once spent dissociating.

I'm not "better" - not by any shape of the word - but we're at least more prepared to work with each other to get things done. And even then, if we have a breakdown we have close, found family there to help us through. They've literally seen the worst DID can dish out and still stuck around, which honestly is a lot to say!

It's been three months since our last episode and things are good. Twi started some jazz piano lessons that keep us busy. Misty tried cooking and discovered she's terrible at it; we all got a laugh out of her poor excuse of a ravoli dish. Lucy took some voice lessons and now claims we are a "vocal astronaut." Addie spent more time out when work isn't going on, as they didn't need to work as hard to keep us on an even keel at work anymore. Even Samantha is starting to come out of her shell a bit!  

It's late 2024 here and the only big event I have to frame this scene with is how D and I learned to grill a pizza. Long story short, I went on a bit of a pizza tear this summer and discovered that our pizza stone perfectly fits our tiny tailgating grill. So D threw together some dough, I bought some toppings, and we made a night of experimenting with a new technique. We opened a fancy bottle of wine and made a royal mess of our kitchen, making this whole thing from scratch.  

But I could make messes now. Nobody yells when I make a mess.

Fresh pizza on the grill, we focused on the wine. We had this silly little subscription service that sends us bottles they recommend, and each one comes with a card that explains what you're "supposed" to taste. D and I take wild guesses that are usually wrong, hoping to match at least a few of the flavor profiles.

"Slate and melon."

"Baking spices and orange."

"Baking spices is cheating!"

"Just because it's common doesn't mean it's cheating," they counter, and we looked to the card. We were wrong on all counts, of course, and that's part of the fun.

In the stillness we listened to the sizzle of dough and the crash of freshwater waves over the rocks.

"It's so weird." I said, and before D could ask I added, "Weird to be just... here. And okay."

"You've done so much work to get here."

"Yeah. and I feel like... well." I shrug. "Regrets. I have regrets. With how we behaved when things were, well, you know."

"When you were actively going through a mental health breakdown?"

I laughed. "Yeah. That. I was in that water... gosh. Almost three years ago, now, with that knife and everything."

"Feeling better about it?"

"Warmer, for sure." I laughed. "Lake Michigan isn't too kind in October."

D had a way of waiting when there was more to be said. And believe me, I wanted to. But when the panic died off, and we were no longer actively in crisis, we were left with retrospection and a little bit of shame. One of the stranger parts of having a public mental breakdown is the shame you eventually feel for needing that help in the first place. And sitting there, watching the cool, late summer sun set behind high-rises across the street, I tried to answer the unasked question.

"There's so many conversations I wish I could undo, so many letters left unsent. So many efforts to connect that I wish I could have stopped decades ago. Had I only known then what we all know now, maybe I could have acted differently.

"Maybe I could have avoided all the drama by keeping my mouth shut."

D was smart to stay quiet.

"Yeah, I blew up a relationship with my family. Yes, they deserved it, in my opinion. I mean, we mark the anniversary of that mess with champagne every year. But in a way, I guess I... I had to?"

"Yeah?"

"To scream and be angry and see how the chips fell," I said. "To let myself be mad, and in my anger see who would cast me off like a leper. Nobody should have to make that choice. Hell, they could have decided to reach out anyway, pretend to believe me."

I took a deep drink of the wine. Part of my brain was back on the beach, knife in hand, considering the end of my life. But I felt no fear, no surprise, no anger: I simply looked inside and reminded everyone just how safe we were.

"I made the right decision, D. We weren't going to feel safe until we knew for sure nobody would come for us. But I wish we made it differently."

"Can't grow without a little regret."

"Yeah." Another pull of the wine. Apparently someone inside wanted to be drunk right then and there; I made a point to put down the glass before they could get their wish. Misty suggested weed.

Misty _always_ suggested weed, we corrected ourselves with a chuckle.

"It's a shame this won't last."

"What?"

My eyes drifted to the concrete floor of our balcony. "The calm. There's still dozens of kids in here, all holding onto their secrets. We're going to have to face it all.

"I feel healed, and yet I know this won't last. I know they'll be bad symptom days, weeks, and even months in the future. No matter what I do there's always a chance I'll be a nine-year-old when an adult is needed, or someone's house will trigger a full on episode, whatever. I feel like a prized crystal unicorn that breaks if you so much as touch a weak spot."

"But you're still here."

I grabbed for the wine glass and raised it up. Yes, I am still here. Yes, I am safe. Yes, things are calm. That's all true, even if the future can't be known. We can face it, no matter what.

"For now," I said, half-smiling.

"For now."

We touched glasses. And in that moment the sun kissed our balcony with honey-yellow glow, the smell of tomatoes wafting from our balcony garden, carmelizing bread on the grill. Waves rose and crashed against the beach.

For now, I'm safe. For now, I'm okay. For now, I'm just happy to live, learn, and vibe.  

For now I can let go and live in the moment, free of fear. A soft joy welled up within me, and when I reached down into my heart I could feel all of our selves together in a single moment, content and warm.

"For now," I said to everyone inside, and a cheer erupted within me that was loud enough to drown out the mighty Lake Michigan, her waves returning to us the confidence we'd lost back in October 2019. A good steward, Lady Michigan. Always comes through when you need her.

And before you ask, yes. The pizzas were fantastic. Best we’ve ever managed to do from scratch.

## Twi, 2021

Things didn’t get better after we returned to Chicago.

There was usually this “game face” we could put on to get through stressful times, a way to cut off the emotions at the root to survive. But this memory, these kids? They felt like a gaping wound, bleeding the will to live right out of me. I would lay down to sleep and have flashbacks, get up and have flashbacks, sit the wrong way and have flashbacks… basically, if i was awake and not totally in control of my environment, flashbacks happened.

I started isolating from everyone and everything. Most days were spent dissociating and watching YouTube. Sometimes I didn’t even leave the bed, choosing instead to lay and wallow in misery. I forgot to eat on many days, and D was sure to point it out when they saw it. But then, well, I started hiding.

“I’m fine,” I said, convinced that my poker face would cover up my puffy eyes and dead stare.

“It’s just tough,” I said, trying to distract myself from thinking through yet another plan to unalive myself.

Then, to top it all off, I woke up one September day with a herniated disc. Standing was impossible, sitting was painful, and every step I took was like pouring fire down my leg. I knew how to solve it - walk until it feels better - but in the interim I spent most of my days laying on the floor. I’d piled up some pillows and an iPad onto a yoga mat to keep busy since everything I wanted to do required standing, sitting, or otherwise not this super comfortable prone position.

Existing was pain. Laying down and doing nothing helped, but in that big expanse of “nothing” was a nonstop barrage of painful memories, smiling men with sweaty hair, wet spots on the bed—

Listening inside I heard crying. My body began to shake as the men with sweaty hair told me how good a boy I was.  

“I need ice, hon.” But D already knew. I was always the last to know I was in active crisis, it seemed. Didn’t matter how much mindfulness work I did, or how much I tracked my emotions, every other person in a room with me would know I was in the middle of a meltdown.          

I breathed, and grounded. D pushed the ice to my wrist and I gasped. A switch. Adult. “Thanks,” they said, and we tried to settle back down in a way that wasn’t painful, both mentally and physically.

I felt tired. Tired of my little condo, tired of work, tired of hurting, tired of… well, everything! If it wasn’t work it was therapy, or doctor’s appointments, or worst of all the nights I fell into a bottle to escape the pain and memories.

Flashbacks became more intense. I would be fine one second, and then come to twenty minutes later, laying on the ground and humping the air, tears piling up on the living room rug. I lost count of the number of kids who came out around this time, but we decided that after 100 alters it was best to stop trying to keep score.                  

I was definitely suicidal, sure, but there was something else in there too: _hope_.

I wasn’t fighting the thought alone anymore. I had my wife, my family, and most important of all, my system. This was going to be the Arcades vs. the Trauma, and we weren’t in the habit of losing.

## Zoe, 2021

The kids were all in the Dark Place.

It was cold, and there was water there, and they screamed for our help all the time. The adults didn’t hear it but I do, when we were almost asleep or when we got too drunk.

And I heard really, really bad memories from there too. The Bustle whispers them to me sometimes. Of Sunday School carpets, camera lenses, wood paneling and shag carpet.

I know Twi doesn’t want to die anymore and I’m happy about that. But if he wanted to die, that would be okay. I was tired of the screaming too. Dying meant I could go see grandma and that would be really nice…

## Addie, 2021

### “So you want to kill yourself: a safety plan for the Arcades”

1. Identify all alters who want to die, and all alters who want to live. Abstentions are allowed, but if you miss your chance to say your peace and we do it anyway, that’s on you.
2. If we are actively suicidal, pull out the phone tree and start trying to make contact with a friend.
3. If we are not actively suicidal, allow all parties inside to argue their cases.
4. A suicide vote must be unanimous.
5. Bring it up at the next therapy session, if you’re still alive .


## Twi, 2021

I was sitting on a bed in the real world, willing myself down into dissociation with the help of meditation. In headspace, I grabbed the PA microphone hanging behind the bar and spoke:

“I need help or we are going to die.”

It echoed inside the head. There was feedback. Fuzz on the line.

“If we do it this time, there are no brakes to stop the car.”

Honestly, I wasn’t trying to convince anyone in my head to go along with it. I was just blurting out my id, hoping to whoever watches over us multiples that the others would stop me. Because given the choice between “accept that my family harbored child predators” and a gun to the head, I was really liking the smell of gunpowder. I swear, at some point I bought a gun. That memory feels so real! Surely that had to be a real memory, and the gun was still in the condo somewhere, unlike all these men with sweaty hair and smiling faces—

I banged the bar, hard, and all the pins in the arcade tilted. “We will absolutely, positively die this time!”

Laughter echoed from the back of the arcade. Lucy shouted from the back: “We won’t. And don’t bang the bar! You know it sets the littles off.”

“We got so close last time, Lucy. I don’t know if I can chance it happening again. I won’t have the self control for it.”

“…fine. Give me a second and I’ll own you with logic.”

I laughed. “That’ll be the day.”

She emerged from the back of the arcade, huffing and puffing the entire way. “There,” she said, and I heard her dusting imaginary dust off her hands. “Right, Okay. So killing yourself.”

“Yes, you’re finally going to take me seriously!”

“Of course.” She winked. “So you want to die. Why?”

“I can’t live with this kind of evil in the world.” I spat the words with bile. “Where kids get hurt like this.”

“You’ve always known it happens.”

“It’s different when it’s me.”

“Fine.” She made a finger gun to point at my chest. “Bang! You’re dead. What happens next?” She even blew the smoke off the finger gun, bless.

“Well, I get relief.”

“And what then?”

“Not my problem.” I folded my arms under my chest and huffed. “I’ll be dead.”

Another poke at the chest. “And you’ll destroy D’s world. And you’ll break the hearts of a hundred plus people in Chicago, minimum. And you know who else you’ll kill?”

My ears perked at that. “I mean, I’d be dead.”

“Yep. Murder suicide.” She pointed the gun at her own head and dropped the thumb hammer before making a dramatic scene of dying on the hardwood floor. There were wails, wallows, even a little “I’m melting!” pantomime as she slowly, agonizingly slowly, knelt to play dead in my head. Then she laid still and silent. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth.

“Okay, I give up. Tell me the logic.”

“Not even gonna play along?”

“Nope!”

“Party pooper.” She got up, dusted off her clothes, and met my eyes again. “What happens then? You’ve shot yourself in the head, we’re dead. What’s next?”

My breath caught the words before I could say them. She saw the reaction, of course, and insisted I spit it out. “I… okay, I feel dumb now.”

“Say it.”

“I thought I’d start feeling better.”

“You’d be fucking dead, Twi. And in doing so you’d murder every man, woman, and child living in this head.”

“But—“

“Do you want Zoe to die, Twi?”

“Of course not!”

She waited.

“I mean, I made a mistake, Lucy. Forgot that we all shared a head.

“The kids need us.”

“They have you.”

“They need _us_,” she corrected me. “All of us. Working together and taking these memories seriously. Why do you think they were kept from us for so long?”

“I just thought, well.” My shoulders fell. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”

“That’s okay,” Lucy said. “It’s why we’re a team. So, just to wrap up this _lovely_ conversation, nobody in this head would dare think about killing the body, right?”

She glared at me, arms crossed and pupils blazing with intensity.

“Correct.”

“Because that would mean killing over 400 people inside this head right now without their consent.”  

“Yeah…” I did a double take. “Wait. 400?”

“You’ll meet them later,” Lucy said. “But they’re all in here, and killing them is a shitty thing to do.”

“We’re on the same page, Lucy.”

“Just confirming.” She gave me a quick hug. “The kids are still kicking up a fuss so I gotta go. But good talk.”

“Thanks.” She turned to run back into the headspace but stopped just shy of the door that led there.

“And Twi?”

I turned my gaze back inwards to see her waving up to me. “I really have to get back to the real world, Lucy!”

“Those fuckers don’t deserve to outlive us.”
  
I smiled at that. “Are we going back to that playbook? Living for spite? Worked out for us when we transitioned, at least.”

“Living for spite,” Lucy said. “Better than dying to spare your abusers their peace of mind.”

## Addie, 2021

I found the steps in the system chat one morning. The message was not signed, but I knew better than to delay and dally when death was on the line.

I had to tell the therapist, of course, and the next day we had an emergency session about suicidality. I knew I was in for it when both my psych and my therapist showed up on Zoom. They were both using the Calm, Concerned Voice you hear right before getting bad news. They asked how I was doing. (Re-experiencing CSA, thanks!) If I was safe. (I wasn’t.) If I had plans. (I did.)         

“Have you considered an outpatient therapy program?” Joey asked. “I think it’s in your best interest to give something like that some consideration. They’d give you skills to regulate and deal with the dissociation.”

“I’m fine,” I tried to say, but I couldn’t even bring myself to believe it. There were hundreds of kids in my head screaming and crying for attention, and the only thing I wanted was for them to stop.

Just… *stop*.

And then it dawned on me: this time, if I let things get too far out of hand, we would not survive the next attempt.                 

I felt more fear in that 10 second pause than I had ever felt in my life.

“What do we have to do to get better?” I asked, and my treatment team drew up a plan.


## Sam, 2021

“What we had to do” was go to the Nuthouse.

Okay, that’s self-effacing. The facility - Compass - was recommended by my therapist and the local queer community. Perfect spot for a dissociated system of hundreds of alters to get things straight. So I called and set an intake appointment, thinking there would be a waitlist instead of a triage process.

The interview was just _normal_ in a way I wasn’t expecting: in many ways, it was just another Zoom call. Lots of forms, insurance discussions, logistics, and rules review.

I panicked with 10 minutes to go before the remote intake session: was this the sort of thing you dress up for, like an interview? Or should I just look grungy as possible to play on staff sympathies? I decided on a plain t-shirt and a blurred background, in case the poor state of the office would come off as too obvious a tell that I was not okay.

Three therapists watched me intently on a zoom call as I answered questions like “are you currently a danger to yourself or others?” I told the truth in a haze of dissociation; of wanting to die, of the trauma, and of the system. They had me take some tests and had me wait while the results came in.

Then, a surprise: “We need to get you in as soon as possible.” I don’t know why, but part of me was expecting rejection out of this, if that makes sense? Like I was still making a big deal out of nothing, and if that were true then the trauma wasn’t that bad. (Nevermind what Zoe shared, and how even sparing the memory a thought was enough to get the dissociative seizures going again. Look, denial is a real freaking thing with this disorder.)

The words “Trauma Program” and “three months’ came up, and my eyes sort of lost their focus. Surely I wasn’t this messed up Then I was off to what would become my full-time day job for the next three months: outpatient therapy.

In any case, I felt like a leech taking a spot from someone who _really_ needed it. And three months? Surely I wasn’t that crazy. Nothing _that_ bad happened because there was no way I was right about the sexual abuse.

(Which yes, I know is a trauma response *now* but still.)                        

I hung up the call and told my wife what happened. Again, no surprise or shock.

I told my friends what was going on. Again, no shock. One friend even offered “you’ve been on the edge of this breakdown for years now” - you know, just making sure I know how crazy I was. 

In the end, the only person shocked that we were partially hospitalized was, well, *us*.

## Addie, 2021

First, outpatient hospitals aren't these desolate, dilapidated buildings with iron bars and bendable knives. Compass was the calmest, most boring office you've ever visited. Calm, grey paint on all the walls, classrooms for group therapy with whiteboard walls, offices for therapists decorated in their own way, and that's about it. Going in felt simultaneously like a dayjob and an extremely safe space.

I don't know what exactly I was expecting the first time I walked into Compass. Strict rules, maybe. No-stab pens, lack of shoelaces, something of the sort. Instead, folks dressed like it was another day at the office. The strictest rules we dealt with regarded privacy and what we could say in group sessions. I agreed to all the rules, signed my name, and was then shepherded to a moderate-sized classroom with a whiteboard wall and comfy chairs. I was told to wait there, so I took some time to settle in.

Another lady sat cross-legged on the ground, chai in hand, ready to start the week. She waved to me as I settled in. I must... gosh, I must have been shaking like a leaf at that point. Losing the plot every ten seconds, jumpy like a box spring, eyes not even bothering to focus on the world around me.

I tried to mask the fear with a little small talk. "So uh, what are you in for?"

(Yeah, I made a jail joke while psychiatrically hospitalized. And yes, it was worth it. -Potts)  

She laughed. "Memory issues. Name's Danica. First day?"

"That obvious." That got a chuckle out of me. We tradad pleasantries for a spell while I regained my confidence.

"What is this like, anyway?"  

"Oh, it's like professional development. Therapist comes in and teaches the class, you take notes. There's meditation and a mood check-in. Are you in the all-day program?"

It took me a second to translate "Partially hospitalized" to an all-day program, I'm ashamed to admit. "Yeah. Long day ahead!"

She cracked a smile. "They teach you a lot of skills here. Stuff you can use in the moment. It's not that bad, really! Like a college class for your brain. I hope it goes well for you!"

"Likewise!" I said with confidence. Oh, how little we knew Compass was going to crack things wide open, back in that classroom. We were too busy thinking about what a good student we could be at the place to give any thought to how fucking hard talking about your core trauma all day would be.


## Lucy , 2021

For the next three months my turned into some twisted version of "The Office." Each morning I'd come to Compass, chat with my "coworkers" at the water cooler, and settle into whatever classroom was assigned to me that day. I made work friends and knew the schedule of my individual therapy sessions as easily as one feels time passing.

Week one was effortless, bordering on fun. The mood program focused on folks with anxiety and depression, for the most part, and that was a crowd I was more than used to being a part of. I started bringing an iPad to class, both for notetaking and for playing games during the breaks. I started dreaming of finishing the program in weeks, not months.

Week two, though? When they put me into the trauma program? Fuck week two.

First off, new group therapy rules started showing up. Details about your trauma were strictly verboten in group, for example. And every day began with a trip to a "grounding closet" full of mints, tactile toys, and ice packs.

Second off? These folks were absolutely, positively, 100% My People. Sure, there were all sorts of folks in the program, but the number of nerds, scene folk, and queer people in this class was an order of magnitude above everything in week one. No longer was I listening to the stories of folks Not Like Me; instead, we were about to rub elbows with trauma just like ours, hard lives, and goddamned amnesia walls falling in my head.

Like for example, the first day we showed up to the trauma program was a Friday, and on those afternoons the trauma group played games. We played charades together and honestly, not a bad way to pass an afternoon when you're too crazy to live a normal life. I thought I was having a good time until it came time to wrap up the session.

"One last meditation," the therapist explained. My teachers' pet ass was *here* for it. I sat cross-legged and settled into my own breath. Hell, I felt like I was going to have a peaceful meditation.

Then the therapist hits us with this: "Reflect on the game you played. Were you present and having fun, or were you *presenting*  yourself as someone who was having fun?"

And honestly? Stupid as it sounds that one broke me. I wasn't present. I was *never* present. Projecting joy? Sure. I could do that all day. But just letting go and being silly in front of other people? Are you kidding me? Not in a million years.

Being present was unsafe because it wasn't controlled.

Addie and I cried for the first time in years that night. Or at least we thought it was years. Turns out the kids had been having episodes for years without us knowing. Gotta love that DID amnesia!


## Addie, 2021

I gave my dad one last chance to explain everything while I was getting into the program. It was a compromise with the insiders: I could only contact that man if we were in good, supportive therapy. Try as I might, I couldn’t let that first phone call from my sister go. 

Everyone else in the family let it go. The family reunited, sans me, and we were slipping back into our old ways. But me? I couldn’t let it go. I _had_ to know, now that I was strong enough to know.

I sent a text to him: "You need to explain what's going on. From what I've heard, you’ve been sexually assaulting people. You've also been trying to pick up your female employees at work, which is a big red flag for me. You need to explain yourself."

And then, for the first time in _ever_, it feels like, he said yes.

In the past, I was terrified of the man. Maybe it was the rough treatment early on. Maybe it was Potts' fear reaction that kept us from pushing this direct conversation. Maybe it was the terror of not knowing about my own past, and that talking to him would give me clarity I wasn't ready for.

But we'd been in therapy for a year at that point and felt like we were ready for whatever. Our drinking was under control and we hadn't thought about killing ourselves in at least two months (a new record at the time!), so we finally felt ready to take this step.

"We're not sure about this," Misty said. "Seems dangerous. Bail”

"Keep the kids inside," I said, hoping she'd get the message and dissociate me away from any emotions those internal alters might bring up. Last thing I needed was to let any errant emotions sneak into my voice while on this call. D stayed on call upstairs, on the off chance that the conversation destabilized us.

I took the call while pacing around my condo. The phone rang right on time; even seeing the name in my phone sent a shiver down my spine. I pushed the green button and buckled in for whatever was going to happen next.

"Hello?"  

"Hello," my father said. There was something different in his voice. Cold. Emotionless. _Honest,_ in a way I hadn't experienced from him before.

"Doing well?" he asked.

"Getting through it. Herniated a disk in my back though."

"How's your wife? Is she doing okay?"

“They are recovering from top surgery right now,” I said, emphasizing the “they.” "We've talked about this before: they aren't a she, Dad. and they're doing fine. I'd like to stay on topic if at all possible."  

He seemed taken aback by that. "Wait. How's work? I have to tell you stories about the warehouses I bought in Virgina. It's a wild one!"

"I told you multiple times that I'm on short-term disability right now. I'm in a partial hospitalization program for Dissociative Identity Disorder."

"Right," as if I had told him the sky was blue, or that it would rain tomorrow. That was all the empathy he could muster in response to forgetting that my life had fallen completely apart over the course of the past few months.

"You know you can always reach out for advice. I raised you, and now that you're older I don't care what you do with your life. I'll always be here though. Like if you divorced your wife, we'd be up there tomorrow with a truck to move your stuff back home."

"Thanks," I said through pursed lips. “Thankfully won’t be necessary; D and I are very happy together.”

“Right.”

I felt as if I were about to dive headfirst into painfully cold water. The only way out was through, though.

“I heard you were accused of harassing your female employees. Tell me more about that."

"Yeah, I did make some of the women in my workplace uncomfortable by asking if they wanted a good time, but no affairs actually came of it! I'm in therapy now so I can know what I did was wrong. Besides, the woman who tried to sue me didn't have a case since she took the promotion I offered after she reported.

"...you still there?"

My eyes were wide with shock and my jaw firmly on the floor. How in the fuck did he just come out and _say all that_? How could you get to the end of that spiel without drifting off into a dissociated shame-spiral that should come along with _I tried to have sex with my subordinate employees and all they got for it was a lousy promotion_, but there was nothing.

"Did I lose you?"

I took a moment to ground, breathe, and keep from laughing. "No, I'm still here. I'm just processing, I guess. It’s a lot.”

"She wanted it," he said by ways of an excuse.

"So you did do it," I said.  

"Yeah. But you know what? I don't like your tone. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around you. Everyone in your life knows you as a girl Austen but I only have memories of old you. And you snap at me when I get the pronouns wrong--"

More paced breathing. More pacing. More shock. _Don't take the bait._ My sole goal in all of this was to stay aloof and professional. Don't let him push buttons. Just get to the facts, and nothing more.  

"I heard about your grandkid,” I said. "You were accused of some fucked-up stuff, and then I got radio silence for two months. What the fuck happened?"

He chuckled - laughed, really. Like this was a common conversation about spilled milk. I'll never forget it; the first thing he did when I brought up alleged child molestation

"Oh, that? I was just giving her a backrub.”

I felt my skin crawl as children inside burbled to the surface. Another deep breath. _Just a few minutes longer, kiddos. I promise._

"We worked it out as a family. Her brothers and sisters still visit but she doesn't come around anymore. Works out for everyone."

I had no response. For the first time, I was seeing my dad for who he really was: a lecherous old man, obsessed with sex, who didn't seem to grasp that what he was doing was extremely fucked up.

"Well, I raised you and you're on your own now. if you want my wisdom, I'll give it, but I don't care what you do, honestly. And besides, I hear that you don't like me or talk to your mom anymore. Is that true?"

(I knew immediately where he got the idea. The only person he and I shared as a social contact was my sister, of whom I thought I was speaking to in confidence. Icy fury bubbled in my veins at the realization, but I pushed it down to stay focused on the conversation at hand.)  

"I'm not talking about what happened fifteen years ago, Dad. I'm here to get the facts."

"I still think you're living in sin, but I have the grace to allow you to be a part of my life anyway. That's family love, Austen. That never changes. That's the facts."

And there it was: \_never changes.\_ even after all my successes, and all the things I did to try and earn his love, I'm still the broken, angry fucking tranny that left his abusive home at 18 to be their own person. And I'll always be that sinful, whiny tranny to him, no matter what I say or do.  

…And by the same token, I would never get past the short-tempered, mean monster six-year old Potts had conjured of him.

But something was different this time: _I knew how to be monstrous too._

"You have no idea what it's been like for me," I snapped. "I can't remember what I did five minutes ago. I never know when some event is going to trigger a full on flashback. I have somatic seizures, dad. From past memories. Past memories I can’t remember, and that everyone insists are made up. But I didn’t make this shit up. Who would?

"Something terrible happened to me." I continued. "That's the thing: this disorder can only happen in extremely abusive homes. Hell, ninety-seven percent of people with DID also have a history of child sexual abuse, _and that includes me!_” I huffed and puffed. “But of course I’m back here, standing in front of you as a total mess, and here I am, asking for the person who did some of those things to notice that I'm hurt, and that my hurt is valid. _Of course it isn’t happening._”

"Oh," he said.

"But I'm going to remember," I told him. "That's the real goal for me. To figure out what happened to break me like this and to make sure it sees the light of day. I’ll get there because you taught me that I needed to be strong from a very young age, and I thank you for that.

“And for fuck's sake, why do you straight men have to give polyamorous folk like me a bad name? Define your relationship with your wife and stay within its goddamn boundaries."

"I didn't know."

"I know. I'm glad you're seeking help, dad. But I can't be a part of that help. I'll be around every once in a while. Like a comet I guess." I smiled through my rage and hoped that the result came out cheerful, but firm. Knowing my track record of autistic miscommunication, I was sure it wouldn’t.

"I really do hope you get better," I said in the silence, and I still mean it. We said our goodbyes, and that we loved each other.

And when it was over, I fell completely apart with all the pent-up rage and fear that had built up over the course of a ten minute conversation.


## Twi, 2024

Again, I don't want this memoir to be the judge of my blood family's current character. I'm sure in the past fifteen years they've grown a lot, changed a lot. Maybe they're better people now. But I am still carrying the damage from this past, and the only way to heal that wound is to tell my story from my perspective.

…Our perspective, I guess.


## Lilith, 2024

Okay hold up, Twi. You're giving them too much credit. Let's do a quick lightning round of the things that this family has done for which we have multiple witnesses who can corroborate the account:

There was the time we were “in trouble” at the age of 30 because we liked a facebook photo of your sister’s birth instead of calling, even though nobody bothered to tell us anything about the events leading up to it. (Other than the baby shower, of course.) Remember how we spent the next three weeks navigating a nervous breakdown because of that interaction?

Or the time our father got power of attorney over an older gentleman he had little relation to. Remember how he sold the place out from under him and the inheritance somehow dried up?

What about the time he moved our stepfamily to Indiana to live in a house he designed, only to kick them out when they started pushing back against his manipulation?

That we still can't hear the words "idiot," "dope," or any of his insulting words without freezing in fear?

Or the way they taught the blind girl how to wash dishes - with insults, denigration, and yelling - to the point that finding a spot on a glass is grounds for a total mental breakdown?

And do you remember how they doubted that all that actually happened?

Look, we don't want you to judge them _now_ for what happened in the past. But these systems thrive because nobody tells the truth; without the truth, patterns can't be identified, and the abusive people get a free pass to write their own narrative as they ride into the sunset. This is our attempt to change that.

I don't care what they're doing. In fact, I don't want to know. They're not welcome in our life and I'm better for it. But I hope that by writing this shitty childhood story I can help at least one person identify their own wounds and seek safety away from their abusive family.

If even one person can escape their own torturous family because this book gave them the courage, it'll be worth all the bad blood and evil I’ve experienced over the past 40 years.

## Potts, 2021

…you know, the last time I had no tasks other than self-care was in 2008, right after I was laid off from my position as an English teacher right out of college. I spent the time playing lots of games, discovering my transness, and losing my blood family, all at the same time. But without a job to stress about, all of these things seemed so easy.

I had forgotten how, well, *nice* it was to not fret about my job performance, or the latest widget that needed releasing, or anything of the sort. For the first time in forever I felt like I could breathe.

First, I slept. I slept a TON. I spent my afternoons writing up lists of things I’d have time to do while going through the program. Then, I started writing again. Mostly in journals, but I managed to write a terrible novella while in the program.
I had expected to catch up on so many things: my electronics projects, music, game backlogs, the like.

But I underestimated how much of a gut-punch this kind of work would be. After a month we started struggling to pick something to do; bringing up the question would get hundreds of answers, and we’d end up spending the rest of the day dissociating into internet videos.

And that’s before we herniated a disc in our back, sapping the last of our resolve. For weeks the only thing I could do was lay down. Walking was agony, sitting was impossible, and our sleep went out the window.

So yeah, imagine meeting 400 of your closest roommates while in the worst pain of your life. It wasn’t pretty. At least some of them were content to doodle in the margins of our notes while we tried to focus at the outpatient center, though…

## Twi, 2021

On the third week, I think, I put down the armor that had kept me safe for decades.

Hate to admit it, but one of my flaws is that I want to be above the fray. Chill and confident projection kept us safe as a child and loved as an adult. Why in the world would I give up on such a good thing?

But I got brave one time and shared some details from my past. “I can’t remember what I do from day to day,” I said to a circle of fellow trauma survivors. Me, I’m on the ground taking studious notes on my iPad and trying to be the best patient I can be, bless.

“Just, my life is a long string of flashbulb memories that make no sense together. I’ll wake up in a place I don’t remember travelling to. And honestly, it scares me.”

“Being a system?” the counselor offered.

I nodded.

“But it’s not your alters, is it? You talk about them with, like, joy and stuff.”

“I don’t follow.”  

“You’re not scared of your system. You’re scared of the trauma.”

And there it was, clear as crystal. I was afraid of being broken, of being vulnerable and open about the things that hurt us so much. Finally, we could relax and live without worrying about being in trouble!

## Addie, 2021

A month after the last call I got a call from dad.

This ended up being the last meaningful conversation I had with my dad, and it all started with a stupid birthday call. See, the only time I spoke to my dad since, gods, high school at least, we made a point to connect on birthdays and holidays. It was my second month at Compass, I think, and I had been in the odd position of receiving not one, but two calls from him while I was under care.

I just wish it had been something more than what it was. A fight, maybe. Something better than me firing off a letter I should never have sent or something like that. But as it stands? Yeah. Birthday.

This time was going to be different, though. I wasn’t going to sit on what was bothering me. Maybe, I reasoned, maybe the issue is that I’m not explicit enough about what’s bothering me. Maybe being direct and firm in my boundaries means I can invite him in.

Maybe, I thought, a conversation about what was actually going on was in order.

I took the call on my bed, surrounded with the littles’ favorite toys in case someone got triggered. D sat within listening distance in case things got too triggery. We got through the pleasantries as best we could.

“How’s work?” he asked.

“I told you, dad. I’m doing a mental health outpatient program. I haven’t worked in a month.” It’s true - we had a few calls while things fell apart. But I was shocked to hear him just forget something so important.

“Oh, right. Hope you feel better.” He said it with no emotion. “You talking about the past still?”

I knew what was next. For the first time in, well, _ever_, I got to look at the chat with fresh eyes. The shocking part was how easy the patterns were to spot, once you knew what to look for. *Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim and Offender,* the program called it.

“I don’t think you realize how much this affecting me,” I said. I could feel my spine stiffen and my eyes furrow with laser focus. With dad it is always, _always_ maximum effort. “I get seizures because of this. I don’t know what day it is, let alone what time it is. I am on the cusp of losing my job at work and this… this is _it_?”

I felt like I could watch a bouncing ball under my dad’s voice, predicting what would happen next. *That didn’t happen. And if it did, it wasn’t that bad. And if it was, that’s not a big deal. And if it is, that’s not my fault. And if it was, I didn’t mean it. And if I did, you deserved it.*

“Well, I did what I could, and you can take my advice if you want it. If you don’t, no sweat off my back. But I’m still family to you. If tomorrow you and D got divorced, we’d be there with a truck the next day to move you back home. That never changes.”

I tilted my head at that. My marriage? There were an endless number of ways to express that familial love; why land on one that requires me to divorce my wife? I tried to laugh to fill the empty space on the phone: “Gosh, dad. D and I are incredibly happy together. I’m not sure why you’d say that.”

But he went on regardless: “You know, it bothers me that you snap at me about your gender. Everyone you know now knows you as a girl, but I have memories of my son, and you bite my hand whenever I get things wrong—“

This conversation is going nowhere. It hasn’t gone anywhere in years. Not for 15 years since my transition have we had a single constructive conversation about it, but to be polite I smile and actively listen in hopes he’ll stop trying to hammer me over the head with a fifteen year old life change—“

## Lilith, 2021

“Please. stop. Addie, Twi, Lucy, all of you.”

We were back in the arcade again, guys. Sorry to yank you out of the story.

Twi straightened out his suspenders and slicked back a lock of green hair. “What are you talking about? We were going over how much Compass helped us. I thought you’d like to us talking about that!”

“No, Twi. You weren’t being truthful.”

Addie gathered her things. She always had “things” inside: a set of pens, a laptop, deck of cards. Always in need of a distraction, an action to do to avoid being alone with her thoughts. “Look, this seems like a you-and-Twi conversation so I’m going to see myself out, if that’s okay.”

“It’s not, Addie.”

She sneered. “Let us back in.”

“No. Not until you admit why we’re here.”

Silence. Twi looked down at his shoes. Addie tilted her head in thought. They both searched for a lifeline, some conversation starter that would get me to back off. Some of the others walked into the bar with us, thinking they could help, but I shot them a harsh stare until they went back inside. Because I wasn’t backing down. Not this time.

“This book isn’t about Dad.”

Twi mumbled, “Tell that to the last three quarters of the book.”

“I… I just.” I pinched the bridge of my nose. “The two of you don’t want to say the words, do you? Gods, you adults are _insufferable_ sometimes. You’re really going to make me be the one to write it, aren’t you?”

They couldn’t meet my eye. 

“We were trafficked, friends. Traf-ficked. Two syllables. Not hard to say.

“And it wasn’t dad.”

Silence filled our brain. After years of constant, low-level voices, it felt weird to hear dead silence.

“Yeah.” Twi said as he kicked the floor. “That thing.”

“It’s high time we talk through it. Talk about what happened to Zoe. What happened to the Bustle.”

Twi stamped his foot on the ground. Glasses on nearby tables shook. “No! The memoir will work without it. We mixed up the details at the start and it can be about whoever we want—”

“That’s not the point, Twi. We didn’t write this book for the world. We wrote it for ourselves. Because if we don’t take the time to write out what happened to us it will never feel real, or whole, or complete.

“Becuase it’s not, folks. It’s a whole goddamn mess, and we’re stuck cleaning it up. But we can make lemonade out of this if we want to. We can show the world what trafficking actually looks like.”

“It’s too intimate.”

“And besides, if we decide differently later we don’t have to keep it in the revision.”

Twi threw up his hands. “Fine. Whatever. I just don’t look forward to it.”

Addie’s raised an eyebrow and resumed her carnival-barking,  desperate, whining deflection. “Yeah, we have to do this, but I figured we could do some more fun stories first, right? Like that time Twi spent, like, five hundred bucks on electronic instruments he didn’t need?”

“Hey!”

“No, Addie. We’re going to face this. Together. For the kids we left behind to face the horrors over and over again. It’s high time we dig the kids out of that dank, horrendous pit.”

“Let’s visit the Dark Place,” I said.
