# To Be Someone Else for One Day
Sometimes I get tired of doing the same thing
Sit still while the people around me are changing
One day I’m gonna find the feeling
What it’d be like
to be someone else for one day?

## Twi, 2021

Sometimes, when things are going terrible, you have to try a new life to get perspective on the one you live.

I have this, uh, thing I like to do. You know how some people like to travel? It’s sort of like that, but more. I’d leave the airport in Chicago alone and arrive in the host city an empty vessel who just moved to town. Instead of sightseeing, I wanted to make friends in the city, share their lives and, well, try to be someone else for one day.

In the aughts, my second life was as a girl in Chicago. In the teens, I was a polyamorous transbian immigrant to perennially weird Toronto. Here, at the end of my rope, I knew exactly what to reach for to get me back on the straight and narrow: a new adventure.

I never understood why we were like this. Maybe this was some weird wanderlust that I never quite got over while moving to Chicago. Maybe it was just my particular weird hobby. Maybe — (and by this he means “definitely” -Misty) — this was the way we made our divergent life paths work.

Being a system is about compromising. We all wanted different things out of life. Gender, career, relationships, hobbies, you can bet we disagree on what to focus our energies on. But out here, in a new city, I get to meet people for the first (and often last) time. With that many at-bats, we got to experiment with what kind of person we wanted to be as a whole system.

I can’t tell you how freeing that was: to know that we could be as inconsistent, weird, and out there as we wanted and _nobody would know about it at home_. It was raw energy in my veins.

Landing in Seattle, I felt like I grew ten years younger, I had so much energy.

This is all a long way of saying that, between the trouble at work and the mess with my dad, I decided to say fuck it, time for a trip to Seattle to see the Cats and meet a whole bunch of systems.

Over the course of the past year the Cats and I had struck up a bit of a relationship over text. At first it was her helping us out, but as we got to know each other as people (and as alters in systems!), we struck up a friendship that bubbled into a little bit of a romance.

That romance lead to meeting a whole new crew of trans, plural folks in Seattle, and the one thing I thought I could do to improve my mental health was fully immerse in the role. Be somewhere where, if you do fall apart, there will be no witnesses at home.

Yeah, my friends in Chicago were amazing and would never think to hurt me with anything I trusted them with, but. Well. Old habits die hard.

So I got the OK from my wife, bought a ticket out to Seattle, and planned to work remotely for the course of a full week with my trans, lesbian, furry, plural system friends. (Look, you picked up a book written by a blind, polyamorous, plural, autistic, furry lesbian. Let’s all be honest and say “we knew this was coming.”)

## Addie, 2011

…right. So in the teens, back when I was running around Toronto and working on how best to pronounce “sorry,” I was driving back home to Indiana and there was this line at the Michigan border. I’d just had the best weekend of my life hanging with my partners in the area, and to be honest, it’s still up there for “best weekends of my life.” (Hard to beat skinny dipping in Lake Ontario and playing an impromptu pop piano concert on the ferry ride home, but I digress.)

There we were, sitting in our little red Fiat and feeling homesick for Kensington Market and Queens Quay, and the thought occurred to us:

“We could just pull up tent stakes and move there.” Tally said. “We could marry Darq and just disappear and _be_ that weirdo who moved to Canada, if we wanted to be.”

“We have a job, though.”

“We could get a new job in Canada. Think about it! _Free healthcare._ Everyone you met made a point to mention it when you said you were from the states!”

I chuckled. “But there’s Chicago, too. Denis is there and he knows people.”

Denis was my college roommate, for reference. He also introduced me to D, so this is one of those butterfly effect moments that could have forever changed the trajectory of my life.

I knew I wasn’t going to convince Tally to go back to Indiana. We loved our friends there but after seeing what life in the big city could be like, we couldn’t waste another moment rotting in that town.

It was heads Toronto, tails Chicago: the only fair way to resolve the conflict in our system.

“American quarter or Canadian loonie?” I asked Tally. She was incredulous at first, I’ll give her that, but I pushed the question. “It’s the only fair way, Tally.”

“Loonie,” Tally said. “Can we put on ‘Heads Carolina, Tails California’ if we’re going to do this?”

“I’ll sing it for you,” I replied, and then hummed the tune while flipping the coin.

## Twi, 2021

All of my bravado, confidence, and ego went out the window the moment the Cats pulled up at the airport. It was one thing to talk to systems on the internet. Meeting a bunch of them in real  life was another thing entirely! I thought, briefly, about escape plans, but at this point I’d lost my driver’s license due to low vision, and getting the tickets would be expensive—

She rolled down the passenger window, leaned forward with her wispy, straight black hair, and yelled my name.

“Hey, Twi! Toss your bags in the back and let’s roll!”

…Yeah. she said _my_ name. I was right to be afraid of this one’s power.

“Excuse me?” I stammered. “How did you do that?”

The Cats flashed a big, warm smile. “You’re very easy to tell. And if you’re plural, it’s _really easy_ to tell your friends’ alters apart! Go ahead, try.”

I tossed my bags in the back to give myself some time to think. Sure enough, I could hear the sternness in her voice, the way her brow furrowed even when she smiled, the sharpness of her breath…

“Soli,” I said, and her smile only grew bigger. “Really? Okay. That’s, well, not what I was expecting. At all.”

“Why’s that?”

“I just wasn’t expecting it to be… uh, visible. Makes it hard to doubt the system’s existence.”

“Enjoy the validation,” Soli said, and then we sped off in her sporty little coupe toward Seattle, my new second home.

## Zoe, 2021

I was in a blue car zipping down a coastal highway. The sun told me it was early mid-day, but _I didn’t have my bags on me. Am I okay? Did someone take me? Oh god gosh I have to get—_

“Hey there!”

It was a lady’s voice, and one I recognized from Discord calls. The Cats! That means this is Seattle, and that means I’m safe. A knot in my stomach unwound.

“Oh!” I said, my face brightening a bit. “Sorry about that.”

“Don’t be sorry!” she said. “And don’t be embarrassed. This happens to people like us. It’s normal.”

“This is so weird.”

“Go On.”

“I remember waiting for the plane,” I said with a frown. “And now I’m just here.”

“Yep! That’s completely normal for you.” She reached for the console. “Let me play you something. There’s a DJ I like who has DID. Do you want to hear what one of their alters put together?”

She played a mashup album that was somewhere between too fast and too overwhelming, but as we adjusted to the overload the entire system sprang to attention to rock out to something I could only explain in the moment as “music for systems, by a system.” The music was nostalgic but new, as much of it’s sound was sampled from 90s video games and top 10 hits. I had a blast naming all the references as we zoomed around the sound.

Around us, the skyline of Seattle peeked out from behind a nearby hill, its skyscrapers long fingers on a hand that waved a welcoming “hello” to me as we sped toward our new second home.

## Sam, 2021

They - and by they, I mean Soli, and all the other cats, and her girlfriend Aimee - lived in a garden-level, one bedroom unit on Capitol Hill. For added “hip young people in the big city sitcom” cred, their apartment included a sliding window that functioned as a second entrance.

It reminded me of my own apartment in the 20s in all the best ways. A rotating cast of characters came through that sliding door; most of whom I already knew through long chats over Discord where we discussed everything from system life to transit proposals for far-off cities.

The most striking thing was all of them were just _there_, openly mentally ill and supporting one another. They talked about their challenges, and knew how to both accept and receive support when their turn came up.

And IDK, maybe that was what I needed. To be around others like me, to feel like I wasn’t a burden on my friends who didn’t have a crippling mental disability like DID. I needed a place where I could just be another messed-up individual among a community of likewise-messed up folk, and know that nothing bad was going to happen.

“We regularly break fire code here,” Soli joked. “Between my twenty, Aimee’s ten, your…” She paused. “However many you actually have in there.”

That caught me off guard and she read my facial expression.

She chided me with a gentle wave of her hand. “I’ve had conversations with your alters, you dork. There’s stuff you don’t know yet, but I bet you will soon. You know why?”

“Why?”

“Because you’re going to let your guard down this vacation.”

Something about her tone of voice made me want to simultaneously obey her and refuse her. On one hand, how dare she just out and _say_ something like that, without considering all the possible angles?

And on the other, how did she say it in a way that made me feel safe and loved?

How did she turn what should have been an insult into an endearing way to say “I support you”?

Soli’s eyes crossed for a moment and her hands went limp. 
A switch. The voice that came out was still the one I remembered, but different. Gone was the confidence and husky alto. Instead, I was looking at a hyper-feminine trans woman living her absolute best life in gender euphoria.

Of course Lexi would come out to break the tension.

“Oh my gosh, you’re here!” She hugged me just as if we hadn’t ridden in the car together. And I guess, in a very real way, we didn’t; that ride belonged to Soli, Twi, and Zoe. Taking that dream logic into account made everything click into place.

The joy present in that room quickly pushed the thought away, though, as both myself and the Cats started rapid-switching to introduce themselves in person. By the time everyone had come up to say hello, we crashed onto the couch, stricken with the vertigo of being a dozen different people within the span of a minute.

There was a safe, cozy energy in the apartment as her cuddle-friendly friends slowly introduced themselves and joined us on the couch

An entire room of trans feminine women, denied their childhoods and raised on hard masculinity, were collectively regaining their ability to give and receive physical affection. There was something very… well, community-focused, obviously, about the whole moment. But it was intensely healing, too.

“Wanna teach me how to play pinball?”

“Thought you’d never ask,” I said, and the cuddle pile dissolved into a bunch of free trans radicals, all excited energy and no place to put it other than to run, run, hard and fast into something so joyful that it could cause our hearts to explode with joy.

## Addie, 2021

“You know we broke the fire code by coming here.”

It was Nebulosa making the joke this time. She’s another trans, lesbian system living on Capitol Hill. Here at Shorty’s, a divey joint near Pike Place Market, she wore her dark brown hair in a low ponytail to better emphasize her fashion choice of the day: a low-key starship fighter pilot uniform. (Which she pulled off *fabulously* by the way.)

She pointed to a sign about total occupancy that I pretended to be able to see. “Just there’s, like, so many alters among all these systems that we’re definitely over a 192 occupants.”

Chuckling at bad system jokes felt good. I hadn’t realized how much shame I felt about my own system experiences when I was back home. Maybe it’s because my friends remembered a different, more stable version of me, and I didn’t want them to feel burdened by this.

“So they do great hot dogs here,” Nebulousa continued. “I think they even do a Chicago style if you want a taste of home.

I looked to the menu of this Seattle dive, hoping I could read the text. No dice. However, something truly unexpected hung on that wall: a mustard-yellow Vienna Beef sign. My Chicago transplant-ass nearly fell out of the chair.

“You’re kidding.”

Lexi touched my shoulder with concern. “What’s wrong?”

Nebulosa looked nervous. “Something I said?”

“One second,” I said, and flagged the bartender down. “Hi. Do you do Chicago Handshakes?”

The bartender’s smile curled into a wicked grin.

“Twelve of those, please,” I said, smiling. “I got a lot of folks to induct to the club.”

“What’s that?” Nebulosa asked.

“It’s a Chicago thing,” I said, and left it at that. “So, you’re a system too?”

“Most of us here are.” We made our way over to a table to wait for the shots. Inside the plexiglass recess of the table was a dilapidated pinball playfield, and I idly traced my fingers along its surface, as if playing pinball in my head.

_They’re all just like me._

“Wild.” I took in the folks in the crowd surrounding me with a sense of awe. “I’m one of, like, two plurals I know in Chicago, and one of those I’m dating.”

Lexi popped her head over my shoulder. “We tend to find each other, you know. Smart kids. Outcasts. Weird kids. We build our own tribe. And it helps to be around other systems, but I can tell by the way you’re relaxing you already knew that.

“Did you want something to drink?”

“I bought a round for everyone,” I said, smiling. “As a thank-you.”

“You didn’t.”

Nebulosa looked at me, her new friend, with a mixture of scorn, curiosity, and concern.

I winked. “They had it. I’m required by Chicago law to do this. Act natural.”

Lexi shook her head. Nebulosa laughed. “Count me in,” she said, and bellied up to the bar to wait for her round.

It was at that point another trans woman made a point to say hello. She was close to my age, polite, and internet-poisoned in all the right ways for a degenerate like myself to love. She introduced herself as the Helixes, and we went through the whole handshake-and-share-system-names back and forth that is apparently standard operating procedure within plural communities.

I want to say that I was getting used to it, but the Helixes had me read for _filth._ She made a point of it, too: with one of her warm, calm hands she took my shoulder and gave it a squeeze.  I didn’t fight the touch and was rewarded with a friendly, gentle squeeze. “Gosh!” she said. “You’re wound up so so tight!

“You’re safe here, you know? Like, nobody is going to hurt you in Seattle. Nobody even *knows you*.”

She left to join the others and I’m not going to lie, it took some time to absorb and process that.

The drinks came out. For those of you who haven’t gone on the Chicago Handshake journey I won’t spoil it here; suffice it to say a great experience was had by all and everyone immediately ordered a second round.

I hissed as the liquor hit my stomach. Something about the burn of alcohol and the smell of cheap Old Style stirred something ancient within me.

There was wood paneling on the walls. Shag carpet dirty with sweat and feet. We were choking and could swear we heard laughter. Our body began to shake and the bar fell away. I wandered in a daze as the world around me gave way to overwhelming static and an animalistic urge to _run_

_It’s happening again. It’s happening and I have to run I have to lose them or else it’s gonna happen again and I don’t want it I don’t want it I don’t want it_

## Twi, 2021

“Come on. Keep breathing. You’re safe.”

I came to standing at street corner in the chilly late summer Seattle air. To my side was the Cats - Lexi, I thought - who had apparently followed me out. She dug around her purse with a quiet intensity. Downtown Seattle was, well, downtown on a weekday evening: empty, save for some bikers and cabbies returning from uptown fares.

“You back with me yet?”

The sound made me jump. “Lexi?”

“No, you dork. Your bud Soli.” A second look at the Cats’ face confirmed it; for all intents and purposes Lexi was really and truly Not there. If I tried to talk to Lexi about this conversation she would literally be at a loss to summarize what happened.

This fucking disorder, man.

“You know it’s me, then.”

“Like I said, you’re very easy to tell.” She plucked something from her purse and gave me a huge hug. “You doing okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“You just went wide-eyed and ran out of a bar. Here, have some system first aid.”

She revealed, pinched between her fingers, a fresh cone joint and a lighter.

“This is ‘Cheetah Piss Cookies.’ You’re gonna think I’m crazy, but I promise you it will help. You’ll thank me later.”

A joint. I was coming back from a flashback and her fix was sparking up a joint. I’m not going to lie, my first instinct was to say “how West-coast of you,” but I swallowed the joke for fear she’d go away.

The last thing I wanted was to be alone with my thoughts on that street corner.

I shrugged and opened my hand. “Fuck it. Let’s smoke this joint.”

She pulled the joint away as I grabbed for it. “You’re not allowed to stop until I tell you to.”

“The hell?”

“Trust me.” She lit the joint and passed it to me. “It’s gonna seem like a lot, I know.”

I could feel my heart pounding hard against my ribcage, as if it were trying to break free. “If you told me it’d help my nerves I’d stand on my head and do a gravity bong like back in college.”

“Good boy,” she said, winking. Fuck, she even knew what gender the alters were and changed her pronouns to match! “Now. Three good puffs.”

"That's a lot of puffs. You're sure?" I took a drag on the joint and willed it to work, to make the bad trailer park in my mind go away. Honestly, with the way I felt inside I'd have done anything Soli said to make the image disappear.

"One more," Soli said. "I promise. It seems like a lot but you need it right now."

I crushed half a joint on my own based on the advice of a twentysomething system I sort of had the hots for. I was 38 years old at the time.

This fucking disorder.

It took a few minutes before the weed worked its magic. The dirty, nasty room with wood paneling was still there, still nagging at the edge of my thoughts. That would never change. But at least now it was less overwhelming and nightmareish. I could put it away for now and it wouldn’t consume me.

"You're good now," Soli said. "Your shoulders just dropped a full inch from relaxing so hard."

I took a deep breath and found the energy to smile. "Wait, the world feels different now. Like, it's closer. Smaller. And if I touch a wall I don't have that weird feeling like I'm going to pass through it without making contact."

"That's called being grounded," Soli said with a smile. "You may not like to hear it, but you have severe trauma that affects your ability to function like a neurotypical human being. This stuff will help you when the symptoms get bad."

"Nothing we've been through was that bad. I mean, there are some unkind things, yes, and there's that big empty hole in my memory that I can't push through, but I'm okay. I'm not disabled or anything, and I certainly don't have trauma bad enough to warrant that kind of breakdown. It's obviously my fault."

Soli took my hand with a laugh and led me back toward the bar. "It isn't. And you have severe trauma; The others have told me."

"...oh, right."  

"Yeah, hard to remember things you're not the only one with control, ainnit?"  

I nodded. "It's so weird."

"The alters?" Soli shook her head. "No, that's normal for you. It's just an adjustment, is all."

"No, the weed I smoked. I don't feel high."

"Yeah," Soli said. "That's a good sign you needed it. Most people, they smoke weed and go from 'normal' to 'high.' People like us? Who use this to manage PTSD? We go from 'extremely triggered' to 'normal.'

"You get used to it, I promise. But for now, teach me some pinball, eh?"

## Addie, 2021

Shorty's was a crowded place at the best of times, but when it crowded with my kind of people, I felt at home.

The bar was built by a Chicago transplant who wanted to bring the Chicago dive to the west coast. The entire lot was cut in half by a dividing wall to suggest the thin, long lots Chicago is famous for. On one side was a bar, hot dog stand, and some fancy tables. On the other: pristine pinball machines, crowded into a tiny space, many of which I had never played before.

I was in my happy place to say the least, and as the hours passed turned back to my pre-system self, dancing between people and generally holding court like a 20's kid who finally found their crowd. Each of my new friends played a different machine and I'd observe them from the side, bringing up little tips and tricks as they drained balls. And to my delight, everyone seemed to have a good time. Some even got involved in their local league, which makes me ever so happy.

Happy. Not just a fleeting feeling anymore, happiness came with a sense of safety and belonging. Look, I get why the psych community doesn't want systems to talk to each other. We trigger each other super easily, and while we can take care of each other these episodes can have a chain-reaction effect, taking out every system in the room.

But here? Surrounded by systems who also survived the kinds of hell we survived? Screw the doctors. It was nice to be just another face in the crowd than being the craziest person in the group.

In a weird way, it was just nice to belong.

I felt a hand on my shoulder, and there was Lexi. (It didn't take me long to get used to reading the Cats the way they read me, turns out.) She wore concerned eyes and a huge grin.  

"Doing okay? Soli told me what happened."

"...right, Twi and the kiddo. You know, the strangest thing just happened. I had almost forgotten it."

"That gets better with time," she said, and then pointed to my squinting eyes. "Oh, Soli gave you the Cheetah Piss Cookies! Knew that weed would work for you. Honestly, any cookie strain is great for PTSD--"

"Hold on."

"And I'm having fun with pinball, too! I knew it was gonna be fun but it's so, so cool when you know what's going on?"

"No, it's weird. I feel fine. Happy, even! But I also know that I just ran out of this place like a wide-eyed, lost little child."

I turned to look at her with wide, confused eyes. "How do you deal with this day after day?"

Her eyes fluttered for a second and there was Soli again, eyes furrowed and stern. "First? The word you're looking for isn't 'like.' You _were_ a scared little child running out of a noisy, strange bar, in a very real and very inescapable way. The sooner you accept that, the easier this journey will be."

"And second?"

"Tell that dork Twi to stop ruminating on it. You're a system, and you're beautiful just the way y'all are.”

We played a few more rounds of pinball as the night grew long, but my head was somewhere else entirely. Not quite "anxious to make new friends," and not quite "surely these folks are going to hurt me eventually." It was something new entirely:

_Safety._  

The bar filled with the late night crowd and the crew decided to head home for the night. We got a bag of Dick’s and the whole dirty dozen of trans, poly, plural folk piled into the Cats' apartment. We stayed there and talked until dawn peeked over the country and painted Puget Sound with its early morning light.

## Sam, 2021

In the haze of dawn’s early light the crew headed to their homes. Meanwhile, I made myself busy getting comfortable on the couch for a good afternoon’s sleep.

“What are you doing?” Lexi asked.

“Sleeping, I thought.”

Lexi’s girlfriend Aimee laughed. “You’re welcome to join us if you want.”

So my girlfriends and I slept together that night. It’s no metaphor; we just cuddled and slept. And being there with them, knowing that my system was safe no matter what, I slept better than I had in a long while.

## Twi, 2021

Being away from home meant I could mess with my gender, too. Most days I in Chicago I didn’t get to dress up the way that I wanted to. Not as a person, but as an alter; a dapper dude and wannabe bartender. But here? Freed from any long-term consequences for my experimentation? You better believe I was going to go for guy mode.

That’s how I ended up in a soup dumpling joint with my new girlfriend Aimee, wearing a button-up, a binder, and the tiniest bit of beard shadow. Yes, the others had just spent the past 15 years trying to _not_ look like this. I wish I had an explanation for how that worked, but I’m just a guy. Sorry if that’s weird.

“How are you liking Seattle so far?”

Aimee posed the question. She had this cute smile when she asks it because she already knew the answer; I love it here. The people are weird, there’s lots of pinball, and everyone I’ve met has been an absolute treat.

“You don’t have to answer,” Aimee said with a wink.

“Oh, it’s nice! It’s got me thinking about moving.”

Look, we didn’t all want to end up in Chicago. We’re still over-the-moon happy here, but there’s a lot of fun in thinking about the what-may-have-beens. What would the system look like if Tally won the coin flip and we’d spent the past 15 years absorbing as much Canadiana as humanly possible? What if — oh gods — what if I never left Indiana?

But imagining life as a Seattlite if I were the only one driving the body? Sure, the resulting mess would have been life-ruining in the real world, but it was fun to run with my little version of the dream for a little while.

“Oh, there’s an apartment upstairs that’s for rent. You and D could move in.”

I remembered, in that moment, reading case studies about systems who ended up in a fugue state and, in that state, made some massive decisions. (I mean, “one way international flight” levels of big decisions.) I’ve run away from friends before without meaning to, only to come back wearing clothes I didn’t own before. Or there have been projects I’ve been told I did that I can’t remember doing.

Moments like this, where my heart literally filled to bursting with the desire to start a new life, made those wild, unbelievable stories of fugue state travel a little more believable. The last thing I needed to do was give into the impulse, so I laughed and waved the table off.

“I love the city and I want to visit, but I have a home and a wife in Chicago. And an entire found family!”

Amy’s friends’ eyes widened. “Oh, we were just messing around.”

“I know, I know.” I laughed and stuffed a shrimp roll in my face to buy some time. “Give us a second.”

Us. Yeah, we used plural language around strangers sometimes. Partially because we forget to mask and pretend to be a single person around others. Partially because here I knew there was no harm in messing up a new relationship because of my plurality.

I finished up the roll and started again. “So, one of the things about this condition is that I can’t remember what I did from day to day. In fact, I don’t even know what or who I want to be from moment to moment, because we all want different things. I love thinking about it, but I gotta keep the future bias in check, you know?

“I’ve made a great life for myself, and I want to make Seattle my, uh,” I counted on my fingers for effect, “third home, after Chicago and Toronto.”

Aimee lifted her martini and clinked it against my glass. “Couldn’t have said it better myself,” she said with a chuckle, and downed a good swig of the martini. 

She hissed as the alcohol burned its way down and we all shared a good laugh about the fact that I very nearly agreed to move here without even contacting my wife.

(Sorry, honey, things get weird in the moment!)

## Zoe, 2021

I was full of really good Chinese food and hanging out with my friend Rosie that night. She was part of Aimee but now that we’re not at the fancy Chinese place we get to be kids with each other and that was super nice.

We laid on the couch and held hands and whispered secrets to each other. “We can pretend it’s a sleepover,” Rosie said, and I was super excited to get out sleeping bags and popcorn but we didn’t have any.

Rosie told me some really sad things that happened to her, and I told her some sad things that happened to me. It felt good to share. I like sharing. It makes the bad stuff hurt your heart less.

(Around us, a small segment of the Seattle crew watched as the two of us acted like literal four year olds on the couch. “That’s Rosie and Zoe,” Lexi said to the others. “They’re both very little and want to be friends. I’m sure the adults will be back in a second.” I could have come up to explain that yes, I’ll be back in a second, but Zoe was having waaay too much fun to interrupt. -Addie)

“I’m glad I got a friend my age,” Rosie said. Our eyes met and there, caught in the twinkling of the eyes of a thirtysomething body being driven by a system kid, was glassy-eyed longing. We were in Seattle, sure, and we were adults. But in that moment it was just me and Rosie, hurt kids hoping to make friends!

So we linked pinkies and swore to be best friends forever.

“That’s good,” I said with a smile. “You’ll stay a while now. I can’t, uh, keep friends.”

“Aww.” She grabbed my hands and squeezed. “Well, you’re going to be nice and safe here I promise! There’s adults watching us so we can just be ourselves without worrying about it.”

“Promise?”

“Promise.” She squeezed my hands harder. “You’re safe here, Zoe. I double promise.”

I flashed a big smile. “Okay. Can we make music then?”

## Addie, 2021

I came to with the body already in motion, so I tried my best to be still and watch from a dissociated distance.

The system kids were kinds of like scared little bunnies in that way - if you showed the tiniest bit of interest in them, they were gone. But here, surrounded by new friends in a place that my old family and abusers couldn't get to? I could relax and let the kids do their thing.

I was on the Cats' large couch, holding hands with Aimee. There was this innocence in the way we made that contact, as if it were the first time we let someone in and it still felt so new and *exciting*  to everyone inside!

Sure enough, there she was making beats on Twi's little groovebox. He got it for our birthday a year or so back, "just to see if I like it," and now it goes everywhere we go. The thing with Zoe, though, was how effortless and *good*  she was at making music. Without so much as a hitch in her step her fingers slid across the lighted pads, and out came what she described as "house music for a trashy sushi bar."

It also made me feel terribly silly, realizing that an alter in my system knows how to make music as easily as one breathes and, try as I may, I wasn't allowed to access that power. So many little talents hiding in here, all held back by barriers meant to keep the bad stuff from destroying us.

“Just like how our planning ability goes to shit when you aren't in front,” Misty added.

No wonder we don't trust ourselves anymore. Who would, when what you're able to do depends on the day and the alter fronting?

"I think she's just excited to meet other littles," Lexi said. She was speaking with another plural we met in Seattle. The Helixes stopped by to say hello; we had plans to go out for a hike in a large forest preserve the next day. I guess she came over to hang out, but as soon as she saw the two littles on the couch she kept busy with Lexi.

We must have been a sight to see, with Rosie and Zoe playing like toddlers while the adults looked on, chuckling.

"Hi Helix!" Zoe said. She waved this big, silly, childlike wave.

"Hi Zoe-bo-bantha!" Alex replied. "Having fun?"

"Wait." The world snapped into focus and I shot up ramrod-straight. "Oh god, I'm so sorry. I must look like an idiot over here, pretending to be a kid--"

Lexi's eyes turned stern. "Addie! Hey! Zoe was taking her turn fronting."

"It's really rude to keep your littles down like that," Helix added. "They are just as real as the adult alters are, and they deserve to make safe decisions too."

"Yeah, that." Her voice turned back to sing-song: "Go back to making friends with Rosie, Zoe! The adults are just chatting. You're safe!"

That's all the more encouragement Zoe needed to pop back out. There was no discussion, no negotiation: one second I was in control and ashamed, and the next I was just, well, Zoe, 9 years old and feeling really safe. Something about being around other systems plus everyone being at the internet-strangers stage of making friends made me relax enough for her to take back control.

Potts put a hand on my shoulder. “Be proud of her. When is she going to have the chance to do this again, Addie? Play with another kid just like her? Relax. This is normal for people like us.”

Zoe's smile carved deep dimples onto my cheeks. The beat mutated under her fingers: first into a slow shuffle, then disco, until she was making etherial ambient patterns to twiddle parameter dials to.

Across the couch, Rosie watched the groovebox's lights dance to and fro. "That's neat. Did you know I played guitar?"

"No! We should jam out sometime!"

We listened in silence for a few moments more.

"You're gonna be a real good friend," Rosie said. It wasn't pointed at the system as a whole; in fact, I could already feel the memory slipping away in the moment.
  
Zoe’s face turned grim. "I'm terrified of when the rug gets pulled."

"What rug?"

"When you find out who I really am, of course." Zoe chuckled. "Once people do that they stop coming around."

Rosie's face fell. "There is no rug pull, friends."

"I just can't keep friends. I don't know why."

Rosie gave my hands a squeeze. "We're not going anywhere."

Zoe looked over to the adults in the room to make sure I saw them nodding in agreement.

## Addie, 2021

"Magic mushrooms just, like, *grow*  in Seattle. If you know what you're looking for you can just pick 'em."

Alex pointed out good patches for the shrooms as we walked through the cool air and beautiful vistas of the Seattle Arboretum. Wrens sang their wandering song overhead, and my footsteps released petrichor as we walked. Of _course_ magic mushrooms just grew here; what else could one expect from a place as weird as Seattle?

She walked the paths with a familiarity that we envied, honestly. To know a space so completely that every sight, every corner, every moment could be visualized as if going off some internal map. Me, I had my cane and was doing my best to tap along. It was still early, and I tripped on a few roots here and there, but I’d like to think I did a decent job navigating.

The first thing you notice about Helix is just how, well, *gender*  they all are. In the span of an hour you could see everything from hyperfemme diva to withdrawn shy boy, and every combination in between. We had talked about our trauma in broad strokes and decided it was better for both of us if we just left it at "we are way too similar to not have the same trauma.”

We stopped at the top of a hill that overlooked the sound. And me, autistic as usual, jumped right into it. “So. How's it feel to be in the 'mental health breakdown in your 30s' club?"

The Helixes laughed at that. “Right into it, then.”

“I’m just curious,” I said. “How did it go down for you?”

We walked down into a lightly forested ravine. Above, a plane approached SeaTac, its engine noise scattering the wrens for a good long spell.

“I found my system while I was working as a coder. And I was good at my job, too - I was the senior you called when you needed someone to fix a sticky technical solution. But finding out about the others made me realize why conventional therapy wasn’t working, so it was good at first!”

I nodded along. We walked around a bend that overlooked a deep valley and we paused there, looking out onto the grey horizon.

“It started with a lack of focus, I guess. Used to churn through code like it was no big thing, but as Covid went on I just… I just couldn’t anymore. Then there were the flashbacks, and the memory loss, and, well…”

They started to walk again.

“I asked for medical leave, they gave it to me. Then I kept finding more alters, and more alters, and fragments of things that used to be alters. Some days I don’t know which way is up. Some days I’m a kid trapped in a human body; others, I’m barely getting by without having more brain issues.”

I took a deep breath and hissed. Talking about it from the inside was one thing. Hearing it out of someone else’s mouth, and realizing that it applied to you? That’s a different thing entirely.

“I know your pain,” I said at last, and we kept walking.

“How about you?”

“Oh, I’m still employed, so that’s good. I’m really lucky to be remote right now so that I can work on getting the system under control and settled.”

“I take it it’s not going well?”

“To say the least.”

We walked in silence for a few moments more before I realized they were doing the same “stay quiet until you open up” trick I did earlier and honestly, *how dare they.* I managed a laugh in the quiet: “Guess I’m not getting out of talking about my problems, am I?”

“Nope!”

“Gah, okay. Fine. So yes, I have a job right now. It’s pretty nice, all told, and pays well. But I know I’m not as good at the job as I used to be. It’s the little things I keep missing. The meetings I forget. The balls I drop, you know? Stuff that should be easy but is insanely hard when you have coworkers in your head.”

Ahead, I could hear a runner approaching on the right. I stopped talking until she passed.

“So that's the hard part, I guess. I *know* I'm worse at my job than I was before. It's like... it's like I can remember *who*  I used to be, and what I used to be capable of, but for the life of me I can't recognize that person in myself right now."

"Like you were replaced?"

I considered that for a moment. "No. Like I'm broken. Like the person I was before can never exist again, because to do so would kill me.”

Helix nodded. “Same. It’s an adjustment, after spending your life being the high-flyer, isn’t it?”

“Yeah. I just know that the person that comes out of this,” I tapped my cane hard on the concrete for emphasis, “The, well, *we* that comes out of this will be different. Probably less flashy. Definitely less work-focused. More chill, for sure.”

“I don’t know who you are going to be, but I know you’re amazing right now. want a hug?”

I took it. Helixes give the best hugs.

“It’s funny,” I said, awkwardly trying to change the subject, “The more folks I meet here, the more I want to move here!”

“You can’t, sweetie.” She pointed to my cane. “There’s only a few walkable neighborhoods and transit isn’t advanced enough to cover for that. You’d be stuck at home all day.”

“Oh.”

“Sorry,” Helix said. “I didn’t mean for it to come off that way.”

I laughed it off as best I could. “You’re fine! Not like I’m going to *do* any of this; I have a home, a mortgage, and an amazing wife. I’m happy as a clam. But sometimes I like to, uh, look at how my life tree got pruned, you know?”

They took a seat on a nearby bench. “Tell me more.”

“I imagine growth in life kind of like pruning a tree. If you want branches in one place, you gotta prune back other spaces to encourage the growth. And like, as a kid you can grow in a million different ways, but every time you do you prune a little bit away from what could have been. Maybe those extra video games as kids means we won’t be piano prodigies. Get a BA, and you cut off an entire world of people you wouldn’t have otherwise met. You cut and cut and the tree grows the way you direct it, however twisted and gnarled it may become.

“Every time I come to, I realize someone else in my head has trimmed away branches.” I held up my cane. “Sometimes, I don’t get to make the call on which branch to cut, sure. But the mangled tree that came of me? with all its gnarls and whorls and stray branches? It’s a mess to look at.

“In Seattle, each of us inside gets to experiment with what could have been. Twi can be a dude; I can learn about mushrooms on a hike. Zoe gets to be, well, _Zoe_. Of course we want to stay here forever!”

“She’s a cutie,” Helix said with a shrug. “Can’t argue with that.”

“I just… yeah. I’m happy with how my tree ended up overall. Do I wish the others made different decisions? Yes. (I’d love to find out who tossed out our piano in 2013, for example.) But when I’m here, we can all be different people with different ways of *being alive* and honestly, it feels great. Would the illusion break if I had to do shit like ‘find a job’ and ‘figure out the whole ‘ope, now I gotta convince my wife to go to Seattle’ conversations? You bet! But this isn’t about being feasible. This is about trying on a new identity.

“That’s all, I guess. I’m just playing pretend for a while before I have to back to the real world.”

Helix put a hand on our shoulder and gave a squeeze. “Okay. Two things. One, *please* go see a massage therapist!” She squeezed again, hard, until my neck relaxed. “Seriously, you’re the tightest person I’ve ever met.”

“I bear my heart to you and that’s the first thing I get?” I chuckled. It had only been a few days knowing Helix but I feel like I have a long-lost sister in her. “You weirdo. ‘Sorry about the heartbreak and ennui and stuff but *girl get a massage*! You are catastrophically gay, girl.”

“Guilty!” she rolled her eyes. “Anyway. Right. This ‘new identity’ you’re experimenting with? It’s not a new thing. _This is what DID is_, friend. Never knowing who you are, or who you want to be, until you arrive on the scene and someone inside takes over. You have *always been this way*, Addie, and the sooner you accept that the sooner things will get better.”

I was speechless.

She patted my shoulder. “Now come on; let’s get you home. You wanted to hit the grocery store, right? I can drive you. Come on, slowpoke! Sun’s going down soon!”

## Potts, 2021

The Cats’ apartment filled with the smell of searing meat and roasting potatoes. I had headphones on so that I could listen to showtunes at full volume and mouth the words.

“What’s that smell?” Lexi asked, but I couldn’t hear. Aimee tapped my shoulder to get my attention.

I took off my headphones. “Oh! Sorry. Didn’t want to bother folks, but uh, what’s the point of cooking if you can’t sing and dance, I say.”

“You could put that on for everyone.” Lexi said.

“Yeah. But it’s Broadway today, and I know that’s not everyone’s cup of tea.”

Aimee agreed. “If you like it, we want to listen to it!”

“Okay, but I warn you, I’ve been singing for 30 years and I’m a total nerd about this stuff.” I pulled out my phone, worried over my music library, and threw “Being Alive” to their speakers.

“That didn’t answer my question, though. What’s all this?”

“Sunday dinner– wait, this part is so so good!” I pointed to the speaker and started singing along. “Sorry, this is a fun musical.”

Lexi laughed. “You’re fine!”

“Right. So, y’all made me feel so welcome and so seen as, well, a system. I wanted to do something to thank you, and the first thing that came to mind was sharing a family dinner. So:” I pointed to each pot, “pork tenderloin, roast potatoes, gravy, and a warm brussels sprouts salad.”

Aimee whistled. “Wow, what a spread!”

“Thanks!” I beamed. “Cooking is sort of my thing in the system. I picked it up as a hobby shortly after our family disowned us in ‘08. Mom never taught me to cook so I learned from who I could.” I spun back toward the tenderloin and gave it a flip. The sharp scent of roasted herbs and nutty butter perfumed the air.

“This is basically my childhood,” I said. (Well, I didn’t say it. A little teenage girl inside took my voice from me, but you know how that goes, &c &c.) “At my mom’s house we’d play music really loud and sing along. Mom made sure we got the notes right. And she cooked really nice Sunday roasts that we’d sit around and just, like, talk  about our day.”

“That sounds beautiful.”

“It was nice while it lasted.”

My eyes lowered as I thought about all the family dinners I’d missed over the years because my family simply could not  handle the fact I was trans, among other things.

Lexi pointed to the stereo. “It wasn’t all bad, was it? Now you’re showing us the things you love and that’s cool!”

“That’s what makes everything harder,” I responded. “I love  this vibe. Cooking, singing, chatting with new family? Can’t get any better. But I can’t help remembering what it used to be like, you know, when things were good.”

“And they weren’t always good.”

“Yeah. Help me with this, would you?” I held out a plastic bag to Lexi. “Just hold this open. I’m gonna sous vide the meat.”

“Sounds fancy.”

“My twist on family dinner,” I said with a smile.

The crew from Shorty’s trickled in as I cooked, each making their entrance via the half-height sliding door that functioned as a porch. Some gave me a huge hug, knowing that they wouldn’t see me after today. Others talked about the spread, the music, and video games. Always videogames, with some of these folks, and it suited them just fine!

We crowded around every table the apartment had to offer. Folks crowded around the dining room table, the sectional couch and coffee table, and even a few folks sat on the ground to share the meal. We sipped at wine from mason jars and mix-and-match glasses from the cupboard and told stories from our pasts.

Inside, we felt bubbly. Happy, even! Nobody from my past knew where I was, nobody could contact me unless I let them, and if I decided this was all to embarrassing to think about I could just delete the memory entirely. It felt, well, _freeing_ to have a chance to define myself again, free from any past in Chicago and everywhere else.

That anonymity was at the heart of everything, I think. Even this family dinner was, in a way, an anonymous way to gain family. Out here, nobody can see my mistakes. Out here, people could be held at arm’s length whenever I needed to. Out here, the people I met literally could never  hurt me; at the first sign of an issue I could just walk away, no harm done, back to my wife and family in Chicago.

Out here, surrounded by anonymity, I wasn’t afraid to open up.

When I was a little kid I had this love of costumes. I’d dress up in whatever fun costumes were around and play pretend for a while. Somewhere around elementary school, though, I fell in love with the idea of “invisible” costumes. Something to completely erase my personhood so that I was an empty shell of a person, ready to take on anything without my past failures being dredged up.

I mean, I grew up femme-presenting male in a small town in Indiana. The teasing was pretty overwhelming, and I learned quickly to never show my true self to the world. A town like that gives abusers eyes and ears everywhere, and the only safe solution to the problem was to invent a “false self” that people could fall in love with.

Somewhere along the way, I lost track of who I wanted to be, replaced instead with who I was *supposed* to be. Out here, freed from any expectations, I could reclaim that genuine self. And, if I wanted to, I could bring it home.

*I could let my found family in, if I wanted.*

We finished dinner in quiet contemplation. It was an old skill we learned growing up; be an active listener so you can’t get yelled at for spacing out, but every time you open your mouth you just so happen to deflect to someone else. I’m not proud of it, but we needed the space.

A fight was brewing inside.

“We could come here more often,” Zoe offered. Around us, the crew finished their dinner and busied themselves with doing up the dishes.

“Everyone’s really nice here,” Misty said.

“So is our family back home,” Addie offered. “We’re just so busy trying to show them we’re getting better than we didn’t even offer to let them in.”

“But here, we’re one of many, uh, manys. They get us.”

“Our family could get us,” I said, “if we let them in.”

And then we just fell out.

## Sam, 2021

One of the more embarrassing side effects of DID is the occasional child throwing a temper tantrum. When it happens I can only look on in horror, shame, and a little delight as a literal child cuddled tight to Alex and started to bawl.

Nobody reacted with shock. Indeed, everyone went about their business as if nothing was going on. Kids just have tantrums sometimes, and that’s part and parcel with being a system.

A child inside of me welled up to the surface. “I’m gonna miss Rosie!” they screamed, and then began to wail.

Helix took my hand and led me to a room for some privacy. “Hey sweetie! You’re safe! What’s up?”

“I got to be little with her and she’s so nice! And I’m gonna miss you too! And I’m gonna miss Shorty’s, and Lexi, and Aimee, and Nebulosa, and–“

“I know, I know kiddo. I bet it’s really scary, meeting new friends and not knowing when you’ll be back.”

I nodded. “A lot of my friends stopped coming around when I was growing up. It’s scary.”

“Can I promise you something?”

“Uh-huh?”

“I promise, the adults in your system are gonna bring you back! And I bet you there’s a whole mess of friends and family back home that would be happy seeing you being just the way you are!”

“Really?”

“Promise,” Helix said, and I made her pinky-swear on it.

## Addie, 2021

I came to back in the living room, my arms wrapped around Helix like one might handle a bit of driftwood after a shipwreck. My eyes were moist - again - and the room had gone quiet.

“Back to reality?” Helix asked.

“I think so.” I said. My brain felt like it was full of cotton. The world distorted in strange, dark tones, as if my brain were forcing itself to believe this was just an intense dream. After all, we don’t have little kids living inside our head who hold onto horrible, horrible things! That just can’t be possible.

But there I was, tears still wet on Helix’s shirt, and the evidence was unavoidable. “I’m sorry,” I said to everyone, but no one batted an eye.

“That’s just Tuesday,” Lexi said. “Last week I had a breakdown at an arcade with some friends. Like, full on breakdown. Screaming, crying, lost in trauma time.”

“Oh.”

“We’re used to this kind of stuff.” She waved to us from the door. “You don’t look okay. Can I get you off of the couch and onto the patio? I think you need some air and some grounding exercises to come back to reality.”

She was right; the world around me had the veneer of static. I was tired, despite being wide awake; a sure sign the switches weren’t going to end anytime soon. We even started to wonder if we were awake at all; that perhaps this whole trip happened in a single, disjointed dream.

So I let her take me by the hand and walk me into the chill Seattle nighttime air. The world snapped back into focus and I was back, visibly an adult and fully in control of my faculties. “Never gets old,” I said as I stretched and reminded myself that the body existed in real, three-dimensional space in 2022, not some dreamy dissociated soup of unreal past.

She lit up a joint. “You’re mad triggered,” she said, offering it to me.

Given the choice between ping-ponging between littles and adults all night and being stoned, I took the latter. A long drag later I could feel my muscles relax. The ground stopped feeling like it would give way at any moment and for the moment, I had control.

Inside, the kids needled at my consciousness. It felt like dozens - no, hundreds! - of little children were inside me, locked away in a vault, and the kids had finally broken containment. My skin quivered and my face went pale with terror.

I held up the joint. “So this should settle them?”

She laughed. “Oh, no. You’re gonna have a bad time tonight, probably. But at least with this we can say goodbye to everyone before you break down.”

I could feel the color draining from my body. “What do you mean?”

“Someone inside wants to tell their story tonight, and I think they’re done asking nicely.”

“I… wow. Okay.” I took a deep breath. “I don’t know if I’m ready for that.”

“I don’t think you have a choice,” Lexi said. “Breathe. That kid deserves to be heard. It’ll be easier if you give up control voluntarily.”

Nodding, I took a deep breath. Then my grip on reality was flushed down a long, thin pipe into the recesses of my conscience, unable to see, hear, or know what was talked about that night.


## Zoe, 2021 (CW CSA)

I started to choke.

I was on the couch with Lexi and I felt afraid. We tried to talk but words wouldn’t come; we breathed in tight, gulping breaths, as if trying to breathe around something large in our mouth.

And I knew, I just fucking _know_ what I’m remembering. The same way I know how to breathe, or how adults ask to keep secrets. Scents and sounds assault my brain: musk, maleness, Bounty fabric softener on the white sheets, my screams muffled in a pillow, my hips up and bucking as he plugged my butthole and I cried and I cried and

Gods, he raped me.

He raped me in the shower.

He raped me in the blue bedroom with white curtains.

He raped me in the master bedroom, while everyone else was away watching fireworks I was too afraid to watch.

He raped me in the trailer park and I screamed and nobody came to save me

he raped me

oh god no

## Tally, 2021

“Finally! I figured we’d get to you eventually.”

I came to lying on a stranger’s couch, my hands in hers. The cushion under my face was soaked in tears - more tears than I’d seen on under my eyes in my life. Despite that I felt nothing.

When I say nothing, to be clear, I mean “eerily calm.” I could turn off  panic by my will alone. Should I be concerned that I’m in an apartment I don’t recognize, around people I don’t remember, and crying? Probably. But I’m used to waking up in strange places.

I also needed to vomit for some odd reason, so that was new.

“What’s going on?”

“This is the tenth time you’ve asked that question,” Soli said. Soli! That meant I was at the Cats’ place, on their couch. In Seattle. Shit - was Addie late for a meeting? Best to wake her up and make sure—

“Let me get you some water. Sit up, please?”

Soli went to pull away but I lunged forward, despearte and childlike, to keep in contact. “Nono pwease don’t go pwease stay.”

The words came out hushed - almost a whisper - and with a heavy lisp. as if I couldn’t pronounce my “s” sounds all of a sudden. The horror of this dawned on me a moment later: I had speech therapy when I was in first and second grade.

*This system kid is stuck at six years old. My gods.*

“Can you breathe for me, sweetie?”

I tried my best to follow her breath but I felt a tickle at the back of my throat. “Stay with me,” Soli repeated, breathing in a slow, even pattern. I tried to match the cadence but my voice was vomiting forth something old, something ancient, something barely human.

What came out was a gut reaction, twisted over thirty years, that had grown into this mangled, barbed *thing* on the inside, and I could feel my memory burn with a truth I had forgotten for thirty-two years:

“Dwop it,” a tinny voice said from inside.

“Hi! Who are you—“

“No no nonono drop it drop it it’s not important drop it!”

“I know it’s a lot, sweetie. Breathe. You’re safe. It’s 2024; those people don’t know where you are.”

Then I was choking on nothing. 

“I told them he put his penis in me and they said I should drop it drop it you’ll forget anyway so dwop it.”

My body collapsed on itself for comfort. Soli tossed us a stuffie and we fell onto it like a life preserver at sea.

“Tally? You still there?”

Talking felt like a great effort; as if I was trying to control my body via an awkward remote. “Yeah. I don’t know this kid yet.”

“Does he have a name?”

“Dropper,” I said, not realizing the name would come out of my mouth. “He has memories of telling adults about being raped and locking himself in a bathroom for safety.”

“Holy shit.”

“Yeah, seriously.” A shudder passed over my body and I was the kid again, squeezing her hand ever harder. “Please don’t leave, Soli. Please, please, please!”

She flashed the kind of wide-eyed smile one might use to calm down a child. “I’m not going anywhere! Promise. Can I talk to Tally again? I just want to make sure you’re super safe sweetie!”

I floated somewhere between reality and unreality for a while, willing my body to listen to the commands I gave it. It took some doing before I could speak words again.

“Back,” I said. My brain was reacting to the constant switches by developing a massive headache. “Does this part ever get better?”

“Once you integrate, yes. But that requires orienting the others to the present.” She paused before asking the next question:

“How many of you are in there, anyways?”

I shot a shy smile. “You’ll tell them.”

“You have to tell the others eventually.”

“Fine.” I took a second and tallied with my fingers. “Four.”

“Four?” She laughed. “Yeah _right_. You’re definitely more than four. Fourteen parts? Forty parts?”

“Four hundred.”

A quiet unease filled the room.

“What happened to you?” Soli asked at last.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Apparently, I was supposed to drop it.”

## Twi, 2021

Was this the right way to do it? That’s for someone else to decide. But being around that many systems, in that close a proximity, for even a short period of time had me jumping headfirst into trauma processing.

Not that I had much of a choice in the matter; the kids made all the decisions that weekend. They decided to trust the Seattle crew. They opened up about their traumas because of that trust. And in many ways, knowing what happened was the first step to processing it. Even if it did leave me twitchy and chock-full of untreated PTSD symptoms.

I had no clue how this was going to shake out, but I trusted my gut. I felt relieved to know what was wrong with me, if not disgusted in what I learned. And I was talking to the other parts, finally. Things were supposed to start turning rosy from here, right?

…right?

I thought long and hard about this on the flight back to Chicago. Little did I know that this little system vacation was going to precipitate a complete change to my way of life, but for the moment I contented myself with memories of that big, safe space full of trans folk and plural systems who took in a broken Chicagoan trans girl and nursed her back to something resembling health.
