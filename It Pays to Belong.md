# It Pays to Belong

## Addie, 2021, December 31, 11:55PM
The night I graduated from Compass was New Years’ Eve, and D and I were in no condition to celebrate.

They had recently undergone top surgery and were still recovering. (I think they still had the wound drains installed, actually!) My back was still killing me, so I laid on a yoga mat in the middle of our living room for the remainder of the night.

I fingered my graduation present for getting through Compass: a tiny necklace charm, chosen by the staff to reflect our journey. Ours was a small captain’s wheel, symbolizing that we were now in control of our destiny. (I still have it hanging over my desk, actually.) At the time the cheap little pewter charm meant more than, well, most anything in my life.

Around us, the house was in disarray. Our water heater blew out the day after Thanksgiving, flooding our entire kitchen. A demolition crew came through to save the house from water damage, but as a result we had a destroyed kitchen and were doing dishes in the bathroom sink.

Yeah, to say we were a mess is an understatement.

We sipped cheap champagne from plastic flutes we had purchased for a time when parties were still allowed and could still turn into a rager. Silence filled the room as the clock ticked toward midnight. We wanted to be sleeping, not pretending to enjoy a party.

“We need a vacation,” D said, and I couldn’t have possibly agreed more.

## Potts, 2017
Our family winter cabin vacations started as an escape from the rat race.

We were all in our early thirties at the time and the pressures of pre-pandemic office life were getting to us. Between going into the office every day, evening happy hours with work friends, and other little events that came up through the week, we were all exhausted.

We landed on a winter cabin vacation for two major reasons:

1. There were no good vacations between January and March, so we wanted to invent something to cut through the boredom.
2. This cabin had a fireplace and us city slickers were *determined* to have a raging fire going the whole time we were there.

Getting there required a seven hour drive and a walk down a snow-covered, icy hill. The end product, though, was a wooden hunting lodge with beautiful views of an ice-covered lake. The only thing ahead of us was four uninterrupted days to hang with our chosen family, with no internet, plenty of beers, and a mutual understanding that this vacation was about resting.

Over the past seven hours we had discussed gamifying the vacation, just to make sure we were inspired to relax. We awarded points for doing self-care and the highest score “won” the vacation. Look. We’re a whole gaggle of gay nerds, what else did you expect?

“So did we ever finalize out our point system for the cabin? I think naps are fifteen points, for sure. Doing legitimate self care is five points. If you do finish some big project, that’s like fifty points, right?”

Outside, it was so quiet that you could hear branches creaking a mile away. I could hear my heart pulsing, the wind whipping, and the soft crunch from a rabbit making tracks a few feet away.

Brandon busied himself with unloading firewood from the back of the SUV. “Those numbers sound good, D. The most important thing is that we rest and have a slow, fun, long weekend!”

The others handed me a case of beer and I started to make my way down the hill. It didn’t take long for me to find a patch of ice, though. My footing gave way, but I thought I could ride out the skid. You know, like a kid on a sled, except my sled would be my two useless boots.

That didn’t work out, of course, and a little pebble on the hill sent me flying. Beer cans flew everywhere and my back hit the ice with a satisfying “thud.” I could hear hissing as a few of the cans popped open, turning the fresh snow yellow.

A small part of me - something old, unknown, and terrified - jumped to the front, ready to take whatever abuse we were about to get. Growing up I was a clumsy kid because, well, *low vision*, and that usually led to long shouting matches whenever I broke things.

But here in the present, my family made sure I was okay. They took care of the rest of the hauling so that I could rest. Later, we even laughed about it.

Welcome to a scrapbook of the Arcades’ family vacation.

## Addie, 2021
“You’re only allowed to go down the hill once this year,” Brandon said. “No more accidents!”

I came prepared that year with crampons and a general understanding that the half-blind woman shouldn’t go up and down an icy hill more than absolutely necessary. This time, my job was to get the fire and ambience going while the others hauled things into the house. It made the space feel cozy immediately, which was great after a seven hour car trip.

The crampons did their work and this was the first year since our first time here that I got down without eating it on the ice. A sign, maybe, that things were going to go smooth this year. We felt so confident that the worst was behind us, now that Compass was out of the way. We planned hard for this vacation, too. Brought crayons Jack-Jack for the kids, music making stuff for Twi, games for the adults. We had a whole catalog of grounding strategies, a veritable bounty of thought interruption strategies, and a positive, forward-thinking attitude toward the trauma. Hanging out away from home for four days was going to be a breeze after all this therapy!

That year’s trip also happened a few months after I graduated from the PHP. I wore my little captain’s wheel charm close to my chest, and when I felt like I wasn’t good enough to get through this weekend without a flashback I’d tap it to remind me - us - of how far we’d come. That we could get through an entire weekend and have fun, no flashbacks, if we relied on our therapy skills.

We put on some Carole King on a bluetooth speaker for background music and set about my job of firemaking. Everyone inside my head agreed: we were going to have a great time. Some of the kids wanted to help with the fire so we talked them through building a basic fire. “You start with rumpled newspaper, then sticks, then a log or two. The paper lights the sticks, and the sticks light the log!”

Soon, we had a tiny fire going in the fireplace.

The second that smoke touched my nose, though, I knew I was going to fall out during this vacation. You just get a feel for these things, with time. Can’t control when they happen, but if you learn to look for the signs you can certainly get a flashback forecast.

D’s freezing hand touched my shoulder and the shock of the touch brought me back to my body. “Everything OK inside? You were just staring off into the distance there.”

I shook my head. “I was raped in a place just like this, once. Lakeside property and everything.”

They flashed a look of both sympathy and dismay. “Shit. I’m sorry hon. Are you gonna be okay?”

“I don’t know,” I lied. “No. It’s gonna be flashback town. I just… fuck, D. I didn’t want this to crash into my friends. I don’t want them to see me like this.”

“They all *love* you, hon. You will be fine.”

“I know. It’s hard to feel that, though.”

## Samantha, 2022 (TW CSA)

I opened my eyes and teleported to 1989.

There were adults in the other room playing cards. Their voices sounded like something warm and fuzzy, but the room smelled like beer and gin and smoke. When I smell those things the bad things are going to start happening. It started with the smell, then, the scent of his Seagrams mixed with the moustache as he leaned down to kiss me—

“They’re safe, little one.”

It was a voice I knew from inside my head but in the moment I had lightning in my veins. The man with the black moustache and the whiskey lived in a house like this one. I woke up there once, dazed and sore, after he did bad things to me.

Was I back there again? I couldn’t chance finding out. I was in a great room with no good lines for hiding. But if I went to the bathroom and was sneaky, I could slip out the front door and get help.

“You are alone in the woods with good friends, Samantha. Please calm down. You’re having a flashback!”

I really really wanted to run away. To run and run and find someone who could listen and I could just tell them, _tell them I’m being raped_, it could all be over. But the voice inside was gentle and told me I couldn’t do that. It’s feminine. Loving. Motherly.

“You can’t leave,” she said.

“I want to be alone.”

“Okay. we can do that, little one. Just a moment.”

The world went all fuzzy in that way that makes me want to forget the world. My body moved without me having to think about it, which was really weird. I felt like I was riding on my own shoulder and that was kind of fun.

“Going somewhere?” the boring adults asked.

“Getting a beer,” my voice said, but it wasn’t my voice because it was an adult. The others went back to their game and we slipped through the kitchen to an attached solar. It was dark and there were some hiding places there.

“Safety through obscurity,” Tally said. “You can hide in here if you want. You’re safe.”

I tucked in behind a chair just in case it really was 1989 and the bad man was still looking for me. And then I breathed really really shallow because I didn’t want anyone to hear my breath or give anything away. This never worked, but it gave me a little control over the when..

If you had time you could prepare. Cry a bit, try to get into the place where pain doesn’t hurt anymore and the world is a dull, grey haze. At least this way I’d hear his footsteps in the hall and have a few seconds to prepare.

“Has anyone seen Austen?”

There’s another voice in the other room that sounds familiar. Big friend D. They’re married to the adults in here and when I’m out they act like my big friend and get me stuffies and coloring books and stuff but anyway, yeah, that helped a little bit. They’d fight the bad man if he was here.

Today was a crying day but I had to be quiet because the adults were up and looking for me. I curled up into a tiny little ball and let the tears flow as quietly as I could. They’d find me soon enough, and they’d tell me to stop being a baby about it. But if I cried hard now, I wouldn’t cry when they saw me, and that helped a lot.

D said something else and sounded sad: “Oh god, they’re gone.”

A new voice. A man. Shivers run down my spine.

“I’ll check outside.”

This was it! I curled up tight and checked my sight lines and did my best to play dead. As a final touch I grabbed a quilt from a nearby rack and threw it over myself so I could pretend to be a pile of blankets.

The adults came into the solar once, twice. Each time they missed me. If I hid long enough I could sneak out later, when they were all sleeping. Then the bad man wouldn’t get me.

“Oh gods,” D said. “Last time this happened was the beach incident.”

“We’ll find them.”

I knew I was made when the third adult checked the solar. Our eyes met. In mine, he could see a raw, feral child, shirking from the light, trying desperately to not be seen.

D rushed in with a stuffie and the tears really started to flow. “I’m glad we found you, little one!”

“I’m so sorry,” I said in a shrill, childish voice.

D hugged me. “We’re all just glad you’re safe! Come on. It’s 2022 and we’re with our family at the cabin. Can you take some deep breaths for me? Come on. In, and out.”

I did what they wanted me to do and then fell apart. A dam inside me burst and the tears came out in long, gaping wails. “I wasn’t supposed to come out in front of friends.” I apologized, again and again and again so D wouldn’t be mad at me.

I didn’t want them to see this side of me. The mess. The inner child, terrified and alone, no longer able to care for herself. There was silence, maybe a bit of murmuring, in the other room. Someone inside reacted to the sound with intense shame.

“One of the bad men lived in a place like this.”

“Do you need to check and make sure he’s not here?”

I nodded. “I don’t wanna do it alone.”

“No, no, nonono!” they pet my hair. “Sweetie, I’ll be with you the whole time. I promise! If anyone’s there, I’ll fight ‘em.”

“And you’re a lawyer, so you’d win.”

“…in court!” They took my hand and gently led me to my feet. Familiar faces waited in the kitchen beside the solar, their worried eyes filling me with shame.

“This is Samantha, and she’s nine. She wants to make sure there are no bad men here. Is it okay if we search the house and make sure of that?”

There was a second where I thought the silence would stretch on forever. But no, it took only a moment for Brandon to reply. “Of course! Samantha’s welcome to check every room if she wants. I’m sorry you’re having a rough night. Would you like anything while you’re here?”

D nudged me. “The adults got you dino nuggies.”

“Those please,” I said. Brandon laughed and fiddled with the oven. D walked me around the entire house and there wasn’t a bad man there at all.

I ate a whole big plate of dino nuggies and said hi to the family. They were all really nice and totally got that I wasn’t an adult. And it felt good to just be out and not feel like the adults had to be ashamed of me.

Anyway goodbye now

## Addie, 2022

I came to with a full belly and tears streaming down my face. My entire body screamed with cramps and aches, as if I’d just spent the past hour terrified of the cabin—

Right. It’s DID. It’s _always_ DID getting in the way, isn’t it?

Phil saw me switching and grabbed my attention. “Hey there friend! Who’s up now?”

“Addie. I…” my voice trailed off. “Gosh. I didn’t want you all to see that. I’m so terribly sorry.”

“You’re fine,” Brandon said. “If it helps, this isn’t the worst flashback we’ve been around for.”

“Really?”

Mark chimed in. “Yeah, remember that you forget a lot of things friend!”

DID, man. This shit is a trip.

## Sam, 2023
Brandon, Phil, Mark, and D sat with around the fire with me, crossfaded, watching the sun set over the lake.

(And yes, I’m telling my part in the present tense if I want to, Twi. You should feel lucky I’m trying to help here anyways.)

“It’s funny.”

“What’s that?” Phil said. He sat on a wooden rocking chair, knitting in the dusk and firelight.

“That we can be published and have fans and all that.” The teacup in my hands radiated warmth, and its steamy wisps mixed with the smell of fresh wood smoke. I felt silly - no, I felt needy. That showing something beautiful I created is an overreach, a boundary break that I can never recover from if I bring it up.

But I’m trying to do better about it. Accepting that we’ve achieved things, that we’ve changed people’s lives, that we’ve _lived a consequential life_. And, most dangerous of all, that we should celebrate the achievements we’ve made in this life. That it’s okay to take pride in those accomplishments.

“So I got this letter a few months back.” I opened my computer and started searching. “Was on a platform I didn’t visit that often anymore. But I logged in to download some old files and there it was, this note in my mailbox from a fan. He read my book ten years ago, and took the time to find me and reach out after a reread a few months back.”

“You get fan mail?” Phil asked, incredulous.

“Here and there,” I said, not thinking about how that sentiment must look like on the outside. Fan mail? Hell, I was nominated for an Ursa Major award in high school. I’ve lost more fan mail than I can even count.

“I just didn’t really…, think about it, you know? That you’d get mail.”

“Yeah. I’ve been recognized at bars for my writing. Cons too. And I guess I have fanart hanging up in my house, too.

“I’ve had people tell me that my books changed the entire trajectory of their life. It’s an awesome responsibility.”

Phil shook his head. “Of course you would be that person.”

“Sorry. I don’t like to boast.”

“No, it’s beautiful!” he put down the knitting. “It’s just, I’m not surprised.”

Brandon chimed in from the other room: “I never expect you to have done everything, but I’m never surprised when you say you have done something.”

Laughing, I handed the laptop to Phil so he could read the letter. When he finished he handed the laptop back to me in silence.

“He has *headcanon*, Phil. *And he isn’t even the first one to have that.* Had I not looked at the mailbox I would have missed it entirely.”

He met eyes with me. That is one thing I really love about Phil; even though I can’t see it, he still manages to meet my eyes and make me feel seen.

“You changed that guy’s life,” he said.

“And I don’t remember writing the thing that changed his life. It’s like, like someone else wrote that book. It just *exists* without a creator. But there I am, reading this raw reminder that my writing has reach - has *power* - and I’m just thinking, ‘I don’t deserve this. Someone else made this happen.’ It bothers me.”

“Someone else did do that. In your head, that is.”

“Still. Fucking terrifying, to realize I have that kind of power inside of me.”

“And you use that power responsibly,” Phil said.

“Well, as responsible as a crazy, furry, queer lit writer can be.”

“The most responsible!” Phil said, raising his glass to toast.

## Twi, 2023

We were telling midnight tales around a roaring fire. Outside, the world is asleep save for the occasional snowmobiler buzzing by this corner of the lake. We were all crossfaded and in our feelings, talking about core fears and such, when I felt compelled to tell a story.

“So we’re walking around Gencon in Indianapolis, right? Big gaming con in my hometown. And some years, post-system discovery, that was a bad thing. You know, ghosts of my childhood hiding around every corner of this town. But the con itself’s super fun, worth a visit if you ever want to go. Anyway.

“I was wearing this silly catenby outfit that we jokingly called “A wizard sent their familiar to Bermuda as punishment but the catenby just turned it into a vacation” look, complete with overalls and a button-up and everything. It’s been, gosh. 8 years since I’ve transitioned and usually I can do this con without ever getting identified.

“But there I am, waiting outside the bathroom while D does their business, and this lady stops in front of me with this shocked face. ‘Austen?’ she asked, and then launched into a hug.

“I waggle my cane at her to be, well.” I pretend to wiggle a white cane in real life. “So when she let go I shout, ‘You gotta tell me who you are!’ and come to find out, she’s an old high school friend. Yet _I can’t remember her._ It’s like an itch you can never scratch, memory issues. But yes. Marion.

“I don’t know if I told y’all what all happened, but I’ve had some shit happen at this con. Mess, flashbacks, fallouts. Hell, Our mutual Craig still tells the story of the time I was exhausted and sleeping in the hall, and two moments later I was the loudest, most boistrous version of myself I could possibly be, as if a switch had flipped. Which, well. Obviously I know what that is now, but talk about forty foot tall burning letters screaming ‘YOU HAVE DID’, right?”

Phil nudged me. “Come on! Tell me about Marion.”

“Right. Well turns out she follows me on TikTok and knows about my transition and such. But she introduced me to her husband as ‘the smartest person she’s ever known.’ And I just think, that’s wild, right? Just saying that. Of course she’s met smarter people.”

“Actually…”

Brandon butted in. “We had this conversation yesterday,” he said with a laugh. “You’re stupid smart. Nobody here is surprised when you can just _do_ something none of us know how to do.

“And before you ask, because this is the next question on your queue, yes. We - the collective we, the queer fam - always know who is up. We just assume that you know we know.”

There were nods around the fire, and honestly that scared me a bit. It’s weird to be perceived, I guess.

## Addie 2023

On our way back from the cabin that year we stopped off  some small Wisconsin town near the Dells to wait out a snowstorm. Our attempt to get home was interrupted by a massive blizzard that would either have ended with a night at a hotel or our car in a ditch. I’m glad we chose the former.

To pass the time in the hotel room, Brandon and I chatted about work - or more specifically, the job market. I’d been hunting for a new gig for the past year, on and off, and getting no bites.

“It’s wild. I’m so used to just getting a job, you know? But i’ve had a dozen interviews and no hits. I actually think I’m getting _worse_ as I go about this.”

“That’s just imposter syndrome talking. I’m sure you’ll find something soon! Besides,” he added, leaning in for emphasis, “Didn’t you have that talk with workplace assistance? I’m sure your job will have to accommodate you in some way.”

“Yeah,” I said. “…yeah! It’s weird, though. Did I tell you what the company guy wanted to do?”

“No!”

“He wanted an appointment with my therapist to talk about my DID.” I shook my head. “I swear, I’ve never had an employer talk to my therapist in my entire life until this moment. I didn’t even realize it was a possibility! But yeah. He asked a lot less questions about vision and a lot more about more questions about the system thing, though.”

“That’s weird.”

“He said he’d never considered what was required for that before meeting me, so I’m helping him out a little bit. Which feels cool, I guess, if it helps another person going through this down the way.”

“When do you get news?”

“Monday, probably!”

“You’ll have to let me know how it goes,” he said, and we thought nothing more of it. We probably moved on to telling old work stories or something.

## Twi, 2023
### Why do you sign your pieces?
#### or: the “individuals vs. parts” question

I write this to you from a cozy cabin in Wisconsin. We’re surrounded by friends - family, really - and we’re simply enjoying each other’s company for the long weekend. Soon we’ll go back to Chicago, where we’ll learn what kind of accommodations our company is willing to offer for our eyes and our brain. I wanted to write this while we had a moment to reflect and process what’s happened.

The hill didn’t trip me up this year. Phil offered an arm and my white cane helped me check for ice patches. Inside, the fire roared and our friends stretched in front of it to relax muscles from a long car ride.

The thing is, this disorder kept on kicking the shit out of us.
Work only got harder. dates and deadlines started to slip. I’d spend most workdays staring at the screen, so overwhelmed at the sheer *volume* of work that my brain would just shut down. Or a kid would come out.

But we try to do things that make us happy, like writing.

As a system, preparing to write is like calming down a movie theater full of ten year olds. Can’t start the movie until everyone’s found a seat, settles down, and it’s quiet, after all! We’ve built up a system to get everyone settled in if we need to write something together. It’s one thing to write when you’re the only person in your head; it’s another thing entirely to draft a novel with hundreds of different people screaming in your ear. I would like to provide our ritual for that focus, free of charge, for any multiple who reads this:

First, there’s the Closing Of All Of The Tabs. Between Max and Twi’s coding, Samantha’s obsession with mechanical devices, Sam’s Amazon cart, and all the other wonderful interests you pick up along the way as a system, you end up with a lot of tabs.

“We should pick up juggling again!”

A child jumps up and down to get my attention. Lilith. She’s a sweetheart, even if she tries to be thorny about it. “We could do that, sweetie, but remember the rule about interrupting without permission?”

She scuffed her foot on the ground. “I have to go to the system chat and ask for time. I know.”

“Exactly.” I give her a quick pet on the head. “That get you what you need, girl?”

“…yeah.” Her eyes sparkled. “But you should keep this in the book. That way, anyone who reads it can be like, ‘hey, Arcades! you ever let Lilith do that juggling thing?’ And I’m guaranteed to juggle for life.”

“You know what? I’d absolutely do that with you, Lil! We could practice between meetings at work. Stand up and get active and all that!”

And… right. Where was I? Who was I? Am I still Twi? Nope, not Twi. Can’t remember the last hour of time passing, and apparently I’m doing some sort of freewrite for the book now?Fuck. It’s Potts.

Okay. I got this.

Potts here, taking whatever Twi had planned and doing it better:

A recipe for focus and writing
10 minutes | 1 serving

 1 | browser full of tabs
 3 | projects just sitting around
4-5 | video games the littles want to play
1 | playlist of music everyone can agree on

1. Close all the browser tabs. Save off things people want to remember into our notes.
2. Marvel at the number of silly little projects we start and how few of them ever get finished.
3. Negotiate with the system on post-writing activities. Add alter front scheduling to the calendar as necessary.
4. Repeat until mind calms.
5. Optional: Cannabis can be infused into the focus process for better flavor.

But yeah, Right. Give me a moment to look back.

Funny story how I got here, by the way. Twi made a gin and soda when drafting this section, and by that I mean he poured a single shot of gin, dissociated, and proceeded to clean our bong. Then, someone grabbed the gin, assumed we just wanted a shot for later, and came back upstairs. An hour later, though, I’m sitting here staring at this lonely shot of gin sitting on the counter, untouched.

But settling in for a group writing session, right! We wanted to uh, make an outline I think. Things that happened. Moments like this. Because the inside experience of system life is this incredible machinarium, full of fascinating conflicts and funny stories. We wrote this book to share our pain, but at the same time we want to show you the beauty of system life.

Yeah, it’s chaotic. Yeah, it’s screwed up. And yeah, this moment is going to come off as crazy to many, if not most people, who read this book. But I believe, deep in my heart, that the collective person on these pages is the only person I could have been in, the only way that it could have been, and instead of ending on the pain I want to show you the beauty and joy that come along with system life.

But when we sit down to write, and we’re all up and excited, everyone starts trying to write at once, and we end up with a manuscript that looks like it came from a serial killer or something…

Twi screamed from the back. “Don’t you dare pull out that ‘I’m too crazy’ crap, Addie. We’re not crazy. We’re different.”

My mind blanked for a moment. Eyes fluttered, vertigo swelled. Then I was Addie, in front and in full control.

I think I wrote some of those paragraphs above - no wonder Twi was upset with me!

Anyway, I wanted to laugh at Misty’s gallows humor but crap, sometimes we sit and wonder how it would sound if someone could peek in and hear our train of thoughts. What would they feel between us alters? Kindness? Hope? Anger? Would it scare them to see how differently another brain can work?

Would they pity us over how our plurality formed, or would they see the joy in this experience? We think about it, sometimes, when we experience the comfort of talking to other systems. Of long conversations about our headspaces, of noting switches, of how our alters relate internally, of being _seen_ and _validated_ and known as the individuals we are inside.

It had to be all of us that told this story, not just one alter talking about “the system.” Any one of us telling the story might have got it wrong otherwise.

## Addie, 2023


Two days after we wrote this we were severed from our job. (In reality, well, we were ‘not accommodateable,’ not given a say in the matter, and immediately placed into a process to find me a new job, but the news still stung.)

Despite all the change in our life, the universe still has its sense of comedic timing.

## Addie, 2023 (CW CSA)

For the system, this was a five alarm fire.

Threats to our financial safety hit hard and caused spirals. Oh, and getting emotionally raw like this let the trauma come out every single time.

It was 5PM on a Friday when things started spilling out. First it was tears: huge, sopping-wet tears that seemed to go on forever. D held me and I felt a twinge of embarrassment that I required this much handholding.

“It’s gonna be okay,” D kept saying, but the tears flowed and flowed.

“I’m not gonna get hired ever again!”

“That’s not true.” I know that, of course. We’ve bounced back from things before. But this is a full-on body slam to the ego. In the past there were no limits; I could get any job, do all the hard work, and still get up to grind it out the next day. Bumping into a hard ceiling at 38 laid us real low.

Then I was choking.

“What’s wrong?” D asked, but we couldn’t respond. The choking gave way to a different sensation: salty, metallic, sticky. _I am three feet tall and the big man groaned hard and then_

A cold hand touched the back of my neck and the world snapped back into focus. D started to rub, hard, to help me ground. “Come back to me,” they said, and I clung to the sensation of their hand on our back like an performer swinging on a high trapeze.

I looked to her with a look somewhere between terror and frustration. The taste was gone and I had no idea what just happened. Hell, even writing about this moment got me dissociated to the point of feeling pressure in my throat. In other words, it was a normal day in the system and we were processing another sense memory.

“The usual,” I said. “I’m back, I think. Mostly. Another one of the Bustle kids sharing.”

I pointed to my throat and gagged. No more words needed to be said.

“Makes sense,” they said. “I’m sorry.”

In that moment I realized how small I felt. It was hard to explain, this concept of “small.” It was feeling terrified and childlike, that the world was overwhelming and confusing. Sometimes the world even _feels_ bigger, as if I were watching the world through a child’s eyes.

I pulled away from D, wiped tears from my eyes, and tried to take a deep breath. Sobs racked my lungs as I tried to take in more air.

“Gods, D. The last time I fell apart it was bad. Real bad. I don’t know if I can survive it again.”

My mind rummaged through the attempt in 2019, the worst moments of Compass, of realizing that I was now officially “too crazy” for some jobs in this world, and nothing I could do would change that. No amount of backpedaling, lying, or pleading would put the toothpaste back into the tube: from here on in, I was… well. I was forever going to be the person with the white cane who _lost her fucking marbles_.

_I was broken, vulnerable, and unsalvageable._

I was disabled: truly, completely disabled, in a way that I will never come back from. I was vulnerable, and in many ways the world around me now had to give extra room and extra time to accommodate my deficiencies. And I saw the way people talked to D about my disabilities; ever since I started carrying that cane people talked to them about instead of asking directly.

I had to admit it: “No amount of lying or covering up could take me back to the person I used to be. I’m something new. Broken, but new.”

“I disagree.” D said, taking my hands. “In a way you never were before, the person sitting in front of me is you. The best version of you, because you stopped lying and started being honest.

“And we’re gonna get through this,” they said, putting their other hand on my knee. “Together. You have family now. It’s all going to be okay. I promise.”

“I believe you,” I said, voice still wavering with tears. “Just not in my heart. Not yet. It’s still hurting too bad.”

They hugged me. “I know, baby. I know. And I’ll keep telling you it until you believe it.”


## Twi, 2023
I’ve thought about killing myself once a day, every day, since I was eight.

This self destructive thought is like the bedrock of my personality; just an unending yearning for oblivion, for release, for this whole mess to be _over_. After a while the sadness turns to static and the terror turns to toothless daydreams. I’ve thought through asphyxiation, overdose, knives on the wrists, even suicide by cop; all in the name of making this deep, dark hole in my heart stop hurting.

And yet I’m still here, still struggling, still _living,_ despite everything. And happy, despite that tiny voice that pulls up my failures and suggests that not being alive would atone for my mistakes.

Honestly? DID plus suicidal ideation is a 0/10 experience, would not recommend.

## 2023, 2:30AM, my bathroom

It was 1:30 in the morning and I was sitting on the bathroom floor. Outside, my wife and friends were fast asleep after a long night of supporting me through my newest mental health breakdown.

By every measure I should have been happy, minus the whole “I don’t have a job right now” thing. (Even that wasn’t that big a deal; the company had a duty to place me somewhere in the organization because of ADA law.) Hence there was my manic ass, seated on a cold stone bathroom floor, counting votes.

The Emmengard System once wrote a comic for people who exprience suicidal ideation. It explores the various levels of ideation, from happiness at 0, to passive suicidality at 5, and “if I don’t get help immediately I will die” topping out the scale at 10. I was burying the needle in that scale that night.

“Addie?”

“Yea.”

My tears flowed.

“Sam?”

“Yea.”

The matter at hand is an old, old song for us. “Should we kill ourself?” It’s the same question we’ve been pondering since we were 10 and dissociated beyond all measure. We have so, so many subtle opinions on the subject, too: suicidal ideation has different flavors, different feelings, based on the day.

Today, I’m tired. 

“Twi?”

“I’m so so tired of system stuff, everyone. I don’t want to fight to be okay anymore. I vote yea.”

A deep breath of hope welled up within me. Is this the time we actually make this happen? Maybe this time we’d stop the cycle, do the world a favor, and just fucking _die_.

We brainstormed methods as we sat on the cold, polished stone floor. The thing about suicidal ideation is that after a while it becomes rote. Less existential terror, more “My god, can I raincheck on wanting to die until after I finish this game” exasperation with our suicidal ideation.

“Misty?”

“Yea,” she said. “Let’s be done with this.”

The only thing we wanted in that moment was oblivion. A twinge of nostalgia for the Old Dissociated Days bubbled up, when we could have just shoved all this mess down into the deeps of our memory to keep the party going. Those were the days; we could go so much harder and push so much further than we can now, tired husks we are today.

“Potts?”

“Abstain.” He shrugged in headspace. “What do you want me to say, that we’re going to be okay if we don’t go through with this? Sure, dying sucks. But not getting better? Gods. Who the fuck knows if we will _ever_ get better, you know?”

I let myself daydream about leaping from the roof of my condo building. It would take a minute, maybe two tops between slipping out of the house and sprinting to the edge of the building. Then a single jump, a terrifying three seconds, and splat. It’s over.

Just a few more yeas and this is all over. Thank fuck.

“Max?”

“Absolutely not.”

And just like that, suicide was off the table. “Unanimous decision” is a hard rule in our system when it comes to harming the body, as much as I’d prefer to have more freedom to end our life. But we swore to only do it if everyone said yes, and the votes were cast. I feel like I’m stuck in jury duty deliberation hell, with one contrarian holding up my only chance to rest.

But, like I said, the votes were cast and we weren’t going to die that night.

Sighs of relief and groans of frustration echoed in my brain. We were beyond exhausted, beyond fed up, beyond _any_ meaningful common sense explanation for our situation.

We started crying and gods, everyone, can we tell you how tired we are of crying? Crying about the past, crying about the adults that abused us, crying about existing. We wanted respite from the endless flashbacks; reprieve from the voices in the head.

We wanted the past to have never happened, and if that meant not existing, so be it.

But it wasn’t going to happen tonight, in any case, so we took the long, slow walk of shame from the bathroom back to the bed, where I laid and D wrapped their arms around me. From there it was just breathing, kindness. Gentleness.

“I love you.”

“Love you too.” A catch breath.

“I hit a ten today on the suicide scale.”

Their response was dreamy and mumbled. “What did you say?”

I paused.

“It’s nothing.” It felt horrible but the lie saved face. Better that D have a fantastic night’s sleep than worry about my personal health and well-being the whole night.

Sorry for lying to you, sweetie. It got really bad for a while there.


## Lilith, 2023

I was furious.

Our place was a mess. Our finances were spiraling out of control because we’re afraid to look at them. We’d dodged house chores for what, three years running, because someone abused me a bunch of years ago for not seeing the spots on the glasses? Because some guys used me for their own pleasure?

No. Not anymore. The line had to be drawn here. Either we figured out how to get better or we were going to die. There were no alternatives.

We had four weeks of paid time off, no responsibilities to speak of, and a soft guarantee of a new job when this is all over. I made the case to the system:

“Hey, we’re basically being handed a 30 day leave of absence here. This opportunity may never come again! Let’s try something before we end up dying: what if we tried this whole ‘healing’ thing we learned at Compass, but actually gave a shit this time?”

“You’d have to get Addie on board,” Sam said. “She’s melting down again. She’s stuck thinking in black and white; right now, she thinks she’s getting laid off.”

“She’s not the only one,” Twi said, but I shushed him.

“Look. It’s high time we have an intervention with Addie. Talk about our limits, and how they’re changing as we figure things out. And she needs to let us in.”

To my surprise, everyone agreed to the intervention. I guess when the alternative was a life spent fighting the desire to kill myself, a system can learn to team up real quick.

## Addie, 2023

When the recruiters stopped calling I knew I was deep in the shit.

For years, I was lucky enough to be in demand in my job. (We’re talking “can I take you to lunch to talk through this opportunity?” levels of cold calling, for reference here.) My work persona became more cavalier, more brash, and more open about myself at work.

One thing about us you should know is that we create art to process what’s going on inside our head. On one hand, no shit - therapy is expensive, writing is free - but this often didn’t jive well with maintaining an image on search and social networks.

For a while, it worked great! Being in tech in the teens was like wearing a suit of armor to the workplace; you could get laid off one day and have a job within a week if you flipped your LinkedIn to “looking for work.” In fact, the last four job hops I did were from a recruiter’s lead, and I came out of the exchange with a more prestigious job and a huge raise.

But that person? The one who was everyone’s top choice for a project manager when push came to shove? That’s not me anymore. I’m broken, and I need to temper my expectations.

“At least not right now,” Sam said. I could hear her voice in my head more often than not these days. It’s sort of pleasant, in a way; like you’re in a coffee shop full of your favorite people who keep you from doing self-deprecating things.

I may be a loon, and I may be a cripple, but I had plenty of friends in my head. So I got that going for me.

I spent the first two weeks of the reassignment process reaching out to my old connections. I hoped to rekindle some of that magic from the teens, when jobs were just shelf-ready staples you could get if you knew a thing or two about Javascript. My friends kept ears to the ground for me, but nothing really came up.

See, the market was terrible in late 2023 for tech. Everyone was busy unloading staff from their pandemic hiring sprees, and in the shuffle a bunch of talented developers and project managers were laid off, flooding the market with talent. For the first time since 2008 I was competing with hundreds, if not thousands of these talented people.

Talent, I’d note, that doesn’t have the baggage of a white cane or discussing mental illness in public. I’m not so naive as to think that wouldn’t be a factor in a competitive market. 

“Have we gone too far?” I asked inside.

I could hear Sam speaking over the din of Twi making electronic music. “Hey there, maybe we should take a break from drafting the novel. Get out of the house, maybe even take a shower?”

“I’m fine,” I said. “I haven’t sent my ten resumes yet.”

That was my self-assigned daily quota: find ten new jobs to apply to, create ten specialized versions of my resume, and apply to those jobs. I had to do that before I could do anything else, because if I didn’t do it off the bat the system would forget.

I had 20 days until unemployment. Twenty days.

Back in 2008, losing my job sucked, sure. But I was in my 20s, and my life was a lot more, let’s just say, _supple_ back then. Now? I had a mortgage to pay, cats to feed, and a wife to do good by.

“No. I’m serious, Sam. I think we went too far.”

“This is gonna be good,” Sam said. “Come on then, Addie. Tell me how we fucked up and will never get our life on track again.”

“Just… hey.”

Sam’s voice softened. “Sorry. That was mean. I wanted to try loosening you up, but, well—“

“You’re fine.”

“Phew!” I felt tension in my body release that I hadn’t realized was there.

“I just worry, Sam. All that weird art out there with our name on it. The blog posts from our 20s, books from our 30s, and those videos we did for the Plural Association. We’re an open book when we should have been clamped up tight.”

“Ah, there it is.”

“There _what_ is?”

“You’re the one that’s afraid of our art,” she continued. “I could bring you down here to see why we make it, if you want to.”

“You know I’ve tried. That’s why I’m writing the book; so I can get a glimpse of—“

“—What it looks like on the inside, yeah. Got that. Look.” She took a breath. “Gods, okay. Bear with me here.”

I laughed out loud. Outside of my head D and I sat on the couch. My laptop was on my lap and D was absorbed in a video game. They paused it as I laughed.

“You okay?”

“Yeah,” I replied, tapping on my head. “Just… every single time I sit down to write my parts for this memoir someone comes out and schools me.”

“What’s that?”

“Sam’s about to lay some truth on me,” I said.

“Oh, cool. Have fun with that, Addie. Do you need me to turn anything down?”

“No, I’m good. She’s right here with me even without meditating.”

“That’s progress!” D said.

“But I’m gonna go back inside and talk to her.”

“Have fun!”

“You back?” Sam asked.

“Yeah. D just wanted to check in.”

“We love her.”

“Always!” I imagined jabbing her on the shoulder just a little bit. “So go on then, ruin my day with whatever truth you’re about to rain down on me.”

“Listen. I want you to think deep about who you are.”

I laughed. “Impossible.”

“No, seriously. It’s time for this conversation. We’ve spent the past decade dedicating ourselves to our career. Why?”

“Job security paid for our transition. And this house. And, on top of that, I like my job.”

“Do you?”

“Well, I get paid a lot and I’m good at it, so yeah.”

“But imagine it.” Sam poked my chest. “Not today. Tomorrow. A month from now. A year from now. Hell, _ten years from now_. You’re still a scrummaster, still slinging software fifty to sixty hours a week. And the entire time, instead of working with us, you’d be _fighting_ us the whole way.”

“Work, family, money. Pick two. And we chose work and money. Kinda locked in.”

“We don’t have to keep it that way!” Sam stamped her foot. “I just… yeah. I never wanted the money, I guess. I just wanted to vibe with good, chill people.”

Another voice spoke up. “We could start publishing again, you know. We don’t need to make our living the only thing we live for.”

“We could make some room for family,” Potts said. “Our real family. Here. In Chicago.”

“We’re not asking you to give everything up,” Max said. “Just that maybe - just maybe - you need to pump the brakes a little.”

“Make room for us,” Lilith said. “That, or we’ll make room for ourselves.”

I felt their hands on my back as they all spoke in unison:

“Because when we’re all happy, we’ll all feel better, and that’s how the healing begins.”

Lilith dropped her guard, which shocked me. “Let us in, Addie. Let us help you get on with our life.”

## Misty, 2023

Look, other systems reading this. Lots of the tools the docs give you are useful. DBT kind of rocks. Trauma processing helps. You can pick and choose what parts work best for you.

But when they push meditation, don’t you DARE try to skimp on that.

Early in the reassignment process I had a day to myself in which I had no one in the house and no responsibilities to attend to. Instead of spending that time goofing off Lilith insisted we get back into the habit of talking inside, so we started doing two hours of meditation every day.

And, like, meditation is a loose term here. We’d meditate by doing whatever the system voted on doing next, and then doing that with intention. Maybe we’d spend an hour scrolling our phone, maybe we played piano for a while, maybe we threw on an album and let our eyes rest. But it was all done with intention, with full focus and everyone welcome at the front.

You can’t get there if you can’t talk, and you can’t talk if you don’t meditate.

Start small. Five minutes a day. Then grow it until you’re talking more and agreeing on things. Then y’all will get better. There: I just saved you a few thousand dollars therapy sessions. You’re welcome.

## Addie, 2023

We sat at a small, digital piano facing a window. Outside, I could see the swirl of whitecaps and hear the gentle rush of the surf. I took a breath and put my fingers on the keys.

“Gods, I don’t want to do this.”

It had been about a decade since I played the instrument. But freed from the confines of work stress, one of the alters inside had dragged our tinny little Casio from the closet and set up an impromptu music room in our dining room.

I pulsed a C major chord and took a deep breath. “I’m going to be so bad at it.”

“There are no wrong notes,” Sam said. “Remember what Roan said: it’s called ‘playing’ for a reason. Just let go and see what happens.”

“It’s so silly though. I am not in a music mood.”

“Trust me,” Sam said. I hated when I had to trust the alters. Usually it led to flashbacks, uncomfortable truths, and general discomfort. But try as I might, I couldn’t will myself to stand from the piano bench.

Sam was begging now.“You did meditation so well at Compass, Addie. All you have to do is relax. I promised you a magic trick, and I’ll deliver on it if you just trust a teensy bit more…”

“It’s just…” I groaned. “It’s just weird when I go away. Just blink, and two hours pass, with no memory of it inside.”

“That’s what we’re fixing, dear. Now play.”

The room filled with the sound of poorly played arpeggios as I searched for inspiration. I was, to say the least, a nervous piano player as a kid. In college I took four years of lessons punctuated with panic attacks, perfectionist impulses, and a general feeling of “eventually this will be fun.” Sitting back down to play reminded me of all those unhappy moments spent practicing things I _swore_ I knew already.

“Relax, Addie. Breathe. I want you to stop trying to move the body.”

“What in the world does that mean?”

“Uh, go limp.”

I went to let my body drop but nothing happened. Instead, my fingers continued to dance on the keys. The arpeggios turned into the bassline for “Stand By Me.”

“Freaking out yet?”

“Trying very hard not to,” I replied. “I don’t play piano this well.”

“You are right, you don’t. He does, though.”

I felt, at that moment, a child riding on my shoulders. He couldn’t have been older than eight, maybe nine, and loved to perform. I felt a shyness coming from him as my fingers followed his will.

“What’s your name, kid?”

“Schroder.”

“Like the Peanuts character?”

Schroder nodded. “Yeah. Peanuts are cool. I like playing piano.

“But I stopped playing because people thought I was showing off or they’d point out every wrong note and it wasn’t fun anymore. That and there was the guy who thought I played good and wanted a private concert in his bedroom, but there wasn’t a piano in there!”

I shuddered. Sam steadied me. “Gentle,” she said.

“I’m really sorry that happened to us, bud. Really am. But that’s all in the past, okay?”

“Can I keep playing?”

“As much as you want!” I said, and I felt myself falling down deep into the recesses of my mind as Schroder played on and on.

Then: I was back in the arcade, the sounds of buzzers, bells, and delighted children surrounding me. There must have been hundreds of them running around from the sounds of it! Above, a speaker piped Schroder’s performance throughout the space.

I could see nothing but blackness in that moment. I reached out, desperate to not be in the dark anymore. I felt a child take my hand.

The child spoke: “Oh, Addie, this is so interesting!”

“It’s not interesting, it’s scary as hell!”

“You can’t see a thing?”

I nodded. “Who is this?”

“It’s Max,” the child said. “And I think you’re blind here. You’re literally engaging in black and white thinking,” Max giggled.

She led me to a long, low-slung table. I heard familiar adult voices around me. Max tucked my chair into the table, skipped away, and returned with a rattling bunch of sticks. When she let them go the cane assembled itself with a satisfying series of snaps.

“So you can get around on your own,” Max said, and then took her place at the head of the table. “Okay. First system meeting with Addie in the inner world. Welcome!”

Polite applause hit my ears.

“Am I dreaming?”

Potts said, “Nope. This is just where we go when we’re not fronting.”

Above me, the piano continued to play. “That’s the real world I’m hearing, isn’t it?”

“Yep,” Twi said.

“Kid’s better than you.”

“Okay okay,” Potts said. “Kid’s probably got the stamina for ten minutes alone up front, so let’s get this meeting started. On my agenda: make sure everyone feels like they have an equal say in the life we life. Any other items?”

Sam knocked on the table, suddenly inspired. “Can I add ‘how do we even begin cleaning up after this three-year mental breakdown’ to the list?”

“Done.” Potts paused for a moment. “Addie?”

“Yeah. I’m okay.”

He laughed. “You very obviously aren’t. None of us are. What’s on your mind? This doesn’t work if you don’t share—”

“I don’t want to face patching everything up. From… well.”

I gestured around to the arcade I couldn’t see. “From finding this, I mean. We _lost it_ there.”

Sam giggled. “Not going to lie, we had a pretty cringey three years.”

“Yeah exactly. And furthermore-“ I paused and looked in Twi’s direction. “Sorry, I didn’t to butt in here. Let’s start with your agenda first.”

I could hear the smile in his voice. “No. You’re fine. Keep going!”

“Ok. So.” I took a deep breath and unloaded. “We fucked up our job real bad. We can’t make it a full weekend without having flashbacks. We’ve done _video presentations on our mental health_ that are publicly available. Every bit of advice we received on maintaining our career, we ignored. And now we’re going to pay for it.

“Not to mention the strain I put on everyone while going through this. I can’t even do basic tasks because of my vision, so they have to do so, so much for me. Not like there’s a card for ‘Sorry I found out I’m a system and fucked up our work product / relationship / plans (circle one)’ on Etsy for situations like this.”

“Sure, it was cringe. but do you regret it?”

“If we can’t get a job, yeah!”

“We’re artists, Addie. we _create_ and we _share_. that’s just the kind of people we are. That’s not going to change anytime soon. What’s the alternative - writing books that nobody reads?”

She made me think about the three novellas, four short stories, and two novels that were ready for publication if I only reached out to my publisher.

“We will find work, Addie. And we will clean up our mess of a life. Together, both internally and with the help _our_ family.”

She paused for emphasis there.

“I’m just terrified of what happens after that,” I said. “When we walk into an interview with a white cane. When we have PTSD breakdowns that force us to call off. I just…”

“Say it.”

“My safety net is being good at my job,” I said. “There. I said it. It’s the single most important thing to my world.”

“We know,” Sam said. Laughter drowned out the din of the arcade for a moment. “And that’s why we’re here, I think. To talk about how that’s going to change.”

“I didn’t agree to that.”

“There was a vote inside,” Sam said with a sinister tone. “We carry the majority. If it comes down to it, we can and will remove you as the host of the system.”

I laughed at that.

Sam grew cold. “This is not a laughing matter.”

“OK.”

“We have demands,” Sam said. “Shared hosting duties. Guaranteed time to do the things we want to do - including the kids.”

“You can’t be serious—“

“Including the kids! There’s no deal otherwise. You’re keeping them from fronting.”

“Because they act like children!”

“So? They’re _children._ Raise them right.” She hissed. “Okay. Moving on. Twi wants to take piano lessons with Schroder. Max wants to redo our website. I want time to go out on dates.”

“I mean, that seems reasonable—”

“Dates with guys,” she continued. “Sorry, you didn’t let me finish.”

I shook my head. “No. We’re gay.”

“_You’re_ gay,” she corrected me. “I’m bi, and I deserve to explore that. Moving on.”

“We don’t have time for all of this.”

“Then we make time for this,” Sam continued. “I’m so sorry. this isn’t a negotiation. This is our path forward.”

“You didn’t include me!”

“You were busy doing host things,” Sam corrected me. “Going to work, meeting up with friends, applying to jobs. All you, Addie. And we appreciate that!

“But we have to slow down,” Sam continued. “At least for a while. Take the replacement job at the company. Do something that isn’t leader-focused. Let’s take a year to rest, recover, and learn how to be a good team together.”

“And that means making art again.”

Sam clapped. “Damn straight! We tried being small for so long, Addie. Shrinking ourselves into a safe little box where we couldn’t be hurt. But now? Now we’re safe. We’re secure. We have the space to grow.

“We spent the past decade trying to seem small, and look what it got us, Addie. Let’s try taking up space again. Like Tally used to.”

I laughed. “Don’t have much of a choice, do I?”

Nervous chuckles went around the table. Potts spoke up: “We’re not rejecting you, Addie. We want you along for the ride. Just… we have to have rules now. Boundaries. That’s all.”

“Okay,” I said. “And not because you have the winning hand. I’m tired, guys. And I need the hand.”

“We know,” Sam replied. “And we got you.”

## Potts, 2023

We made the time to heal.

We stopped playing as many video games and cut out some spaces that encouraged it. Not like we could play games forever anyway, what with our eyes getting worse and all. It was better to spend that energy on something that we could do blind: music.

Gods, we took so many music lessons. Voice, just to get our technique checked out after so many years not singing. Then Twi started playing piano, Max started with her electronic music. I studied cooking by improvisation, with mixed results. But the thing is, we started to _try_.

Addie still plays games, of course. We all do! But now, instead of it being our background noise it’s an intentional thing.

We came to an understanding of how the system was to work going forward:

- One alter is “on call” every week for situations where the system gets triggered. That alter is the default personality for their week on call, and if we are ever in trouble the on-call alter is in charge of getting us through it.
- Everyone in the system may have time if they ask for it. And we mean _everyone_. We’ve played with duplo legos and marble runs.
- If someone inside wants something and it’s at an impulse-buy price, we get it.
- Those impulses we experience aren’t random; they’re desires from the others.
- It’s much easier to ask what’s wrong inside than to try figuring it out on your own.
- We are powerful together. Always remember that.

So we spent the impromptu vacation shut in our apartment, trying to de-stress from the whole “oops, you’re no longer employed at your job effective immediately, please try something new” thing at work. We meditated. We followed the rules. Experimented with psych meds.

Anything and everything we could do to make sure we could never be laid this low again, we were willing to do.

With time and hard work things did get better. But word to the wise, if you ever get this diagnosis make sure you research your short-term disability benefits, because you’re probably gonna need ‘em.

## Twi, 2023

Then, just 20 days after the shock of a potential job loss, the panic about our career was over.

Turns out the reassignment process wasn’t a joke; we were moved to a project management position that had nothing to do with tech whatsoever. And you know what? Out of everything that’s happened so far this was the first time everything just fell into place for us.

There were no horrible memories dredged up by some unknown trigger. No anxiety about getting in trouble. One second I expected the sky to fall and the next, there was an entire community around me holding up the sky with whatever we have laying around.

It felt good to have folks go to bat for us.

I landed the perfect job that’s both challenging and full of kind people. We work less than we used to, which was good both for our eyes and for our brain.  Because we only have 10 or 15 years of useful vision left we were very particular in how we spent it.

Time, honestly, seemed to stretch out longer the more integrated we became. Work wasn’t an all-consuming thing anymore, with the fear of job loss hiding around every corner, which helped us relax. The big household chore triggers got better when I started accommodating myself with bright lights and latex gloves. And more we fell into our happy place, the less we wanted to escape to the internal Arcade.

Video games, once an obsession, started to feel like empty calories; why do that when where were a dozen other fun things to do in the moment? We started making more music, more stories, more _art_ to fill our life with joy, meaning, and purpose. It was electricity in the veins, gasoline in the gut; we spent the next year creating new things every day, reveling in the process of play without judgment.

But still, the boredom persisted.

From my experience as an addict, I could say the hardest part of adjusting to a moderate drinking lifestyle was the boredom. I’d say the same was true of us systems; as we integrated further and further, and folks stuck around for more time out in the real world, the longer time started to stretched. Days now dragged on like weeks; weeks, endless slogs that felt unending. Gone were the surprises of early system discovery, replaced by the drudgery of Monday morning meetings and arguing over gym schedules.

But now, when things went bad, we had the skills to deal with the boredom. We were playing music. Writing. Making time for good friends, and for our pursuits whatever they may become in the moment. We can find new joy in life, finally.

This really hit me while vacationing with friends at Rehoboth Beach. First day we were there, I decided I was going to do only the things I wanted to do, no matter what my vacation partners thought. So when we went to the beach, I turned down swimming. (you ever _smell_ an ocean, y’all?) I chose instead to laze on the beach and read a book. Nobody told me it was weird! They even thought I made the _right decision_, knowing that I was a weak swimmer and too blind to find shore alone!

So I was on this beach vacation, still getting paid, waiting for this new job to start. There’s nothing waiting at home for me, no stresses to return to, no responsibility. I read my book and sunbathed. Sometimes I’d make a stop by the boardwalk for window shopping, and that’s where I found myself face to face with a new opportunity.

This little store had a ukulele hanging in the window, and in that moment I wanted nothing more than to take that thing to the beach, no matter the price.

The guy inside saw me and waved me in. Without thinking, I greeted him with a smile and wave. “Gosh, I didn’t even _think_ to bring my ukulele to the beach. I’m glad you’re here!”

“You got a nice one?”

I pointed to the painted wooden ukes on the wall. “Yeah. One like that.”

“Oh, good thing you _didn’t_ bring it! That’s a concert ukulele. The beach would ruin it. Try this instead.”

I walked out with a blue plastic ukulele that apparently was the standard for surfers and outdoorsy people on the coast. My fingers hadn’t touched a string instrument in months - I winced at the feeling of strings turning my fingers to hamburger - but that wouldn’t stop me from trying.

You see, Rehoboth Beach was the basis of one of my favorite cartoons of all time - Steven Universe - and most of the catalogue was simple enough to be playable by even my out-of-practice self. My heart swelled with joy as I found my footing on the beach sands, and after a little assist from friends I was led to the shade of our friends’ rainbow umbrella, the sound of waves crashing into the howling laughter of the gulls around us. The beach was last-weekend-of-the-year levels of busy, and there were people all around me. In any other place I’d have stayed quiet for fear of getting yelled at.

In that moment, though, I pulled out the uke, reminded myself of the chords, and started picking at “Peace and Love on the Planet Earth” from Steven Universe. (Picking is a kindness compared to what I did with that ukulele; to say I’m a competent strings player would be, well, a huge lie.)	But I _played_. And when I stopped worrying what the world might think of me - us - arguing under our breath as we tried to remember fingering patterns - music started to come out.

Honestly, that hooked me. I’m a musician because _I play music_. There’s no amount of “good enough” I have to be to enjoy the fruits of my practice. Furthermore, _I can be good at this._

I played every day on that vacation. At nights we’d hang out for beers and a chat; I’d bring my electronic groove box to set the mood. We’d spend days at the beach and I’d pick at the uke until my fingers couldn’t stand it anymore.

We even found our way  to karaoke that vacation, where we gained video evidence of three different alters singing baritone, tenor, and second soprano decently well! Folks loved it, and even when I failed there was still a round of applause at the end of the song.

I came back from that month a changed person. The Arcades didn’t need the safety of the internal arcade anymore. We could create, and try, and risk things that aren’t just video games or other dissociation traps.

We could live a good life, if we chose it. And we did.

It could have been so much worse.

My extensive white collar career meant I had savings on hand. My government attorney wife had excellent mental health care coverage, so I was able to get therapy twice a week as I worked through the worst of it. I paid three figures for treatment at Compass after insurance did its thing. I was also a passing, white trans woman who could disappear into the background whenever she needed to, which lets me go most anywhere without getting harassed by transphobes.

So, so many things landed in my favor. If any one of those things hadn’t have happened, I’d be dead by now.

Never let it be said I’m not one lucky sonofabitch. Hardworking? Sure. But undeniably lucky for sure.

## Lilith, 2023


I dream, sometimes, about them showing up at our door. My family, that is.

It’s one of those obsessive thoughts I can never fully put to bed; that maybe five or ten years from now they’ll show back up in my life like nothing happened. They live on in my dreams as antagonists, nightmares, and leeches: why wouldn’t they make an appearance in the real world as well?

Besides, I would not be the first person they tried to hoover back up after a discard. Doesn’t matter how hurt someone may have been, time “heals all wounds.” But that’s bullshit. Effort, apologies, and a commitment to change heal wounds. Letting them lie just makes them fester, swell, and hurt.

I tried for years to tell them how much I was hurt: first with stories they rarely read, then with direct conversations that turned into long, meandering discussions about how I was simply wrong. Twice in my life I dropped all pretense to pride and reached out, desperate for support and for the family to fulfill its role once. Each time, my pain went ignored.

There’s a very famous piece in estrangement forums called the “missing missing reasons.” You can read it for yourself if you want, but the crux of the argument is this: abusive people ignore when their targets feel hurt, and when later confronted with evidence of their actions they will conveniently “forget” that the abuse never happened. “Tell me what I did wrong!” seems like a reasonable question, of course, if you ignore the dozens and dozens of times I made my point perfectly clear.

(The point, of course, is to fish for inconsistencies. They’ll then jump on that inconsistency instead of engaging with what their target actually feels, since doing that would require admitting wrongdoing on both sides, but I digress.)

I changed my number because I couldn’t get the nightmare of them contacting me out of my mind. Hell, I’m so controlled by thoughts of this past that I’m writing a fucking _memoir_ about the abuse I experienced. If that doesn’t hint at some big, burning-red-flag missing reasons for my estrangement with my parents, I don’t know what does.

## Potts, 2023

This morning, when I sat down to write my thousand words, I had a clear picture of how the nightmare scenario with my family could go. Not that it will _ever_ come to pass - I’ve been in Chicago for 15 years without a single visit from them - but I’d rather prepare out of an abundance of caution than be caught flat-footed by them.

Besides, I’m sure some of them will thumb through the book to see what I say about them, so chances are good I have the right audience for it.

The scenario my brain tries to scare me with is this: my family shows up to my condo. They sweet-talk their way into the building. They could then enter my condo, corner me, and I’d be back in the shit. But again, that’s just a fantasy meant to scare us. _It wasn’t based in reality._

So if anyone mentioned in this novel has considered some intervention like this… this is how it would go.

Family, I have obsessed over how to say this to you for thirty-five years. After all that navel-gazing, I can encompass the entirety of my hurt, all of my hurt and confusion, with a thirty second speech:

"First and foremost, this is an official notice of trespass. Don’t come to my house again. But since you’re already here: listen. If your God himself came to my bedroom in a bolt of lightning and demanded that I ‘honor my kin’ or face eternal torment, I’m going to develop a taste for brimstone. You had a chance to be a family. You decided to not honor that for me. These are the consequences for those actions. I would now rather suffer eternal torment than be forced to have a conversation with the people who hurt me. Have a good day. Ta!"

Why in the _world_ would I allow folks in my life who treated me as badly as they had?

## Twi, 2024

I’m not proud to say this but I kept expecting things to go badly.

Maybe the job fell through. Maybe I ended up hating my new coworkers. But no, the new job was wonderfully human-focused and my coworkers are absolute gems!

Maybe I’d get tired of the piano stuff. And sure, that could have happened. But in playing we found a new favorite thing to do, and have been on cloud nine with our sessions at the piano ever since.

I kept going to my therapy appointments, trying to dig up some new mound of crap to work through. But nothing came. It felt anticlimactic; after years of swinging at this mess, 

If I’m being honest, I started dreading therapy.

You ever spend 45 minutes making small talk with someone who literally knows every horrible thing you’ve ever been through? Yeah. It’s, uh, an awkward but lovely experience. On one hand, you’re happy to be healed to the point that there’s nothing left to talk about. On the other, 45 minutes is a _lot_ of small talk.

“I think we can graduate down to one session a week,” Joey said.

“Really?”

“You feel stable, don’t you?”

The realization hit me like a truck. It’d been months since we thought about dying, and weeks since we started being actively afraid of suicide. My brain, once a blanket of static fuzz and sudden loud noises, slowed down to reality’s pace. And if you sat me down, right there and then, and tested my memory about the last three days, I’d be able to tell you everything I did. (Sure, it’d take a bit longer than most folks and I’d probably argue out loud at myself, but believe me, we’d _remember the shit out of those days_.)

After three years of cycling between slightly better, getting clobbered by trauma, and struggling to stay stable, here we were on the other side. Tangible progress. After three years of feeling genuinely insane, here we were, suddenly calm and happy. (Still insane, I guess, but it doesn’t feel so bad anymore.)

After three years of hard work on unbelieveable events, disability, and my career falling apart, I was finally just another boring person. 

Another boring person with some dreams they gave up on, but still makes art. The kind of boring person who can smile at you and go about their day. The kind of person who sometimes gets a chance to change peoples’ lives through the acts they do on this Earth, and then does it because that’s a thing we want to see happen in this world.

Lordy, I’m normal. Fucking finally.


## Potts, 2024

Going through a deep, milestone moment is sort of, well, disappointing.

Like, deep down, right in the heart of hearts, we feel like we’re shedding a chrysalis and emerging as a newfound, completely changed self. We want there to be birds singing, credits rolling, something to show for this backslope of Frytag’s Triangle. Yet the days keep going on, turning to months, months to years.

On the outside, it’s Tuesday.

Ever see that movie clip from Street Fighter? (Raul Julia hams it up as the evil dictator Bison, by the way. Watch the film for that alone.) So Chun-Li is telling Bison how his murderous rampages uprooted her entire life, upended her home, and destroyed her people. In response, Bison (who is exchanging his OUTDOOR HAT for his INDOOR HAT at this time and guys, again, I can’t emphasize enough how much trashy, campy goodness this movie is) replies: “I’m sorry, I don’t remember it.”

“For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.”

And honestly, this is the mantra of trauma processing, and why going through it sucks so much. The abusers don’t remember (It’s a Tuesday.) Your mental health isn’t exactly anyone else’s problem (again, Tuesday) unless your actions make it one. And the time you start healing, when you want to scream out to the heavens “HEY LOOK AT ME, I’M HAVING A MAJOR LIFE EVENT RIGHT NOW”?

Yep, Tuesday.

Sure, when you’re falling apart, everyone dotes on you. Who wouldn’t want to help their family, their friends, or their tribe out? So everyone changes their behavior to make you feel better. But as you get better, as your sense of security goes up, and when you’re no longer in visible pain? You’re no longer needing that extra level of care, and it fades. (And yes, this is good! We give and take energy from each other in times of need!) The healing side is harder to celebrate, though.

For you, the day you healed was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.



## Twi, 2024
While drafting this I got a notification that members of r/Blind were getting together for a little chat. I thought about taking a pause to join, but Addie stopped me. “We’re not ready for that yet,” she said, head shaking. I felt her anxiety bubbling over into me.

I closed the chat. “Of course, Addie. Take your time.”

Saying we got some things solved isn’t to say we solved everything. But dang, if the only thing I have to deal with from here on in is occasionally being scared to admit I’m going blind, that’s small potatoes compared to what we conquered before!

For the first time, we’re not scared to enjoy our life. Maybe we don’t always agree on what that means, but we listen, and we try, and we hope. Maybe the trying’s half the fun, and if we fail the world will still be stable.

So yeah, sometimes your midlife crisis involves mourning lost time, sometimes it involves admitting to yourself that your uncle trafficked you for sex with men in your town. Tomato, Tomahto. How was your day?



## Addie, 2024

The memoirs ended not with a bang, but a whimper of calm, stable joy. The flashbacks got shorter, the switches smoother. We became more aware of our body and the passage of time, to a point that we started getting bored with all the spare time we had once spent dissociating.

I'm not "better" - not by any shape of the word - but we're at least more prepared to work with each other to get things done. And even then, if we have a breakdown we have close, found family there to help us through. They've literally seen the worst DID can dish out and still stuck around, which honestly is a lot to say!

It's been three months since our last episode and things are good. Twi started some jazz piano lessons that keep us busy. Misty tried cooking and discovered she's terrible at it; we all got a laugh out of her poor excuse of a ravioli dish. Lucy took some voice lessons and now claims we are a "vocal astronaut." Addie spent more time out when work isn't going on, as they didn't need to work as hard to keep us on an even keel at work anymore. Even Samantha is starting to come out of her shell a bit!  

It's late 2024 here and the only big event I have to frame this scene with is how D and I learned to grill a pizza. Long story short, I went on a bit of a pizza tear this summer and discovered that our pizza stone perfectly fits our tiny tailgating grill. So D threw together some dough, I bought some toppings, and we made a night of experimenting with a new technique. We opened a fancy bottle of wine and made a royal mess of our kitchen, making this whole thing from scratch.  

But I could make messes now. Nobody yells when I make a mess.

Fresh pizza on the grill, we focused on the wine. We had this silly little subscription service that sends us bottles they recommend, and each one comes with a card that explains what you're "supposed" to taste. D and I take wild guesses that are usually wrong, hoping to match at least a few of the flavor profiles.

"Slate and melon."

"Baking spices and orange."

"Baking spices is cheating!"

"Just because it's common doesn't mean it's cheating," they counter, and we looked to the card. We were wrong on all counts, of course, and that's part of the fun.

In the stillness we listened to the sizzle of dough and the crash of freshwater waves over the rocks.

"It's so weird." I said, and before D could ask I added, "Weird to be just... here. And okay."

"You've done so much work to get here."

"Yeah. and I feel like... well." I shrug. "Regrets. I have regrets. With how we behaved when things were, well, you know."

"When you were actively going through a mental health breakdown?"

I laughed. "Yeah. That. I was in that water... gosh. Almost three years ago, now, with that knife and everything."

"Feeling better about it?"

"Warmer, for sure." I laughed. "Lake Michigan isn't too kind in October."

D had a way of waiting when there was more to be said. And believe me, I wanted to. But when the panic died off, and we were no longer actively in crisis, we were left with retrospection and a little bit of shame. One of the stranger parts of having a public mental breakdown is the shame you eventually feel for needing that help in the first place. And sitting there, watching the cool, late summer sun set behind high-rises across the street, I tried to answer the unasked question.

"There's so many conversations I wish I could undo, so many letters left unsent. So many efforts to connect that I wish I could have stopped decades ago. Had I only known then what we all know now, maybe I could have acted differently.

"Maybe I could have avoided all the drama by keeping my mouth shut."

D was smart to stay quiet.

"Yeah, I blew up a relationship with my family. Yes, they deserved it, in my opinion. I mean, we mark the anniversary of that mess with champagne every year. But in a way, I guess I... I had to?"

"Yeah?"

"To scream and be angry and see how the chips fell," I said. "To let myself be mad, and in my anger see who would cast me off like a leper. Nobody should have to make that choice. Hell, they could have decided to reach out anyway, pretend to believe me."

I took a deep drink of the wine. Part of my brain was back on the beach, knife in hand, considering the end of my life. But I felt no fear, no surprise, no anger: I simply looked inside and reminded everyone just how safe we were.

"I made the right decision, D. We weren't going to feel safe until we knew for sure nobody would come for us. But I wish we made it differently."

"Can't grow without a little regret."

"Yeah." Another pull of the wine. Apparently someone inside wanted to be drunk right then and there; I made a point to put down the glass before they could get their wish. Misty suggested weed.

Misty _always_ suggested weed, we corrected ourselves with a chuckle.

"It's a shame this won't last."

"What?"

My eyes drifted to the concrete floor of our balcony. "The calm. There's still dozens of kids in here, all holding onto their secrets. We're going to have to face it all.

"I feel healed, and yet I know this won't last. I know they'll be bad symptom days, weeks, and even months in the future. No matter what I do there's always a chance I'll be a nine-year-old when an adult is needed, or someone's house will trigger a full on episode, whatever. I feel like a prized crystal unicorn that breaks if you so much as touch a weak spot."

"But you're still here."

I grabbed for the wine glass and raised it up. Yes, I am still here. Yes, I am safe. Yes, things are calm. That's all true, even if the future can't be known. We can face it, no matter what.

"For now," I said, half-smiling.

"For now."

We touched glasses. And in that moment the sun kissed our balcony with honey-yellow glow, the smell of tomatoes wafting from our balcony garden, carmelizing bread on the grill. Waves rose and crashed against the beach.

For now, I'm safe. For now, I'm okay. For now, I'm just happy to live, learn, and vibe.  

For now I can let go and live in the moment, free of fear. A soft joy welled up within me, and when I reached down into my heart I could feel all of our selves together in a single moment, content and warm.

"For now," I said to everyone inside, and a cheer erupted within me that was loud enough to drown out the mighty Lake Michigan, her waves returning to us the confidence we'd lost back in October 2019. A good steward, Lady Michigan. Always comes through when you need her.

And before you ask, yes. The pizzas were fantastic. Best we’ve ever managed to do from scratch.
