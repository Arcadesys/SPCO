# Twi | Chicago, 2019
Chicago, 2019. Cold moonlight drenched the stairwell beside Lake Michigan, my hand clenched around a paring knife. Nearby, a balcony party echoed with Polish pop music—a surreal soundtrack to my quiet panic.

Lake water whispered against my building, its rhythm forcing shallow breaths. Above, orange floodlights drowned the scene in stark contrasts. My mind swirled in a drunken haze, a sense of dread crystallizing around two facts:

One: I was severely drunk, though memory failed me on exactly how I'd arrived here—outside my condo, alone, crying by the lake.

Two: I knew why I held the knife. A plan I hadn't consciously crafted whispered urgently: Swim out. Don't come back.

"Austen!"

My wife's voice cut through the chill, their figure sprinting toward me in pajamas and a hoodie. As they embraced me, an internal voice shouted defiantly, urging escape into the icy water.

But the moment D’s arms enveloped me, the suicidal urge softened. Still, the shame lingered—I couldn’t bear to reveal the voices driving my despair.

“I got really sad,” I admitted softly, handing them the knife. They put it to the side without comment.

“Do you need to go to the hospital?” D’s words sent cold dread through my spine.

“No,” I lied. “Just drank too much.”

Inside, I knew something deeper was wrong. My life was supposed to be great—the house, the wife, the successful career—but I felt hollow. Detached.

Standing, I splashed into the freezing lake water, shocking myself back into reality, my body tingling back to life.

That night wasn't just my lowest point—it was the start of uncovering who I truly was. Or rather, who _we_ truly were.

This isn't a tragedy. It's about survival, about finding joy amid the chaos, and living with a brain that dances to its own peculiar rhythm. This is our story, a single-player co-op adventure, messy and wonderful and real.

Welcome to the Arcade.

## Potts | The Arcade, 2024

“TOO DARK! TOO DARK! We can’t start with that! This is supposed to be FUN!”

Surprise, it’s me, Potts! You don’t know me yet but you’ll love me, I promise.

I was wearing costume raccoon ears and a tail and I looked really cool in my little raccoon outfit and listen, okay, I know this isn’t what you had in mind when you picked up a memoir about a person with dissociative identity disorder but BEAR WITH ME, I’ve got a pitch for you.

WHAT. IF. CARTOONS.

So camera pans left, BAM, big explodey star on your TV screen and there I am, a raccoon in a red shirt. I’m all squishy and squashy in the body and zany as all get out, but in the intro you find out I have a heart of gold, deep down under all those cartoon gags and barrels of dynamite and such. I’m one of the kids that lives inside our brain.

Okay okay, so picture this: BAM! You wake up one day and find out there’s a talking raccoon in your head. WHAT. A. REVEAL, right? But that’s not even the weird part.

Me and the kids here? We fight the evil things that hide inside our brain.

They’re… I don’t know. I like to imagine them as thick, swirly tar at the base of our brain, gross and icky as all get out. Like some villain from an old-timey cartoon, sludgy and impossible to punch! The only way to beat them is to outsmart ‘em.

Anything to keep the memories locked inside so they can’t ever hurt us again—

“POTTS!”

Right, uh. Okay.

So one morning the body wakes up and has this big bug-eyed moment where they find out WHAAAAT, there’s a raccoon in their head! Wow, right? And I act like it’s no big thing, I’ve been here all along being silly at the edges of their brain, putting on little shows and singing songs when they get sad.

And, like, uh…

“Potts, Twilight was in the middle of _writing!_”

“Yeah, but her story was dumb and full of butts. Mine’s going to be cooler.”

“That doesn’t matter. We talked about respecting each other’s time, remember?”

So I’m getting kicked out of the front now but long story short, me and the other kids in the Bustle—that’s what we call our little crew inside—kept Addie safe from it for so so many years until she was ready to learn about what really happened okay byebye for real this time—

"Okay okay okay, I’m getting kicked out now! Exit, stage left! WHOOSH!"

----

## Addie | The Arcade, 2024

Back.

I was back?

Where is Twi? Why did I write about my suicide attempt?

Right. Just a moment while I scan up in the draft here…

Oh, yeah. Potts. He’s a wild kid, and we promised him one chapter in this book. You’ll probably hear from him sooner rather than later.

The others gathered around the corner of the cozy wooden bar. To our left, pinball tables flickered with light and sang their solenoid symphony. To our right, a kick-line of dancers put on a rendition of The Interrupters’ “Anything Was Better” on a makeshift stage.

We wanted a happy place inside our mind and this barcade, with all its bells and buzzers and flippers and chorus lines singing in harmony, was perfect for the task.

“It’s strange.”

Twi was talking to himself again. Monologuing. He could get that way inside.

“I’ve written a million words of fiction in my past. Had characters live and breathe inside my brain, and they tell me what they want to do next. But none of that compared to the full-contact experience of writing a book as a system. It’s a game of rugby inside, each of us lateraling ideas that disappear in a puff of smoke if they’re ever dropped. Imagine sharing a controller with a friend and trying to play the hardest game you ever played, and you can begin to imagine it.”

It’s my turn and he knows it, but he can’t bear the thought of being away from the front when we write the Really Good Stuff. (Twilight snaps in response to this sentence: “The stuff that makes your heart sing, like you’ve become a god of your own creation, better than sex, better than anything you’ve ever felt. It’s finally remembering the most wonderful dream you’ve ever dreamt and saying that yes, yes, I’ll write a million more if it means I can feel that rush just one more time. The Madness of Creation.”)

Underfoot was Potts, a six-year-old wearing raccoon ears and a tail. “No fair!” he whined. “I was just getting to the good part.”

“Potts…”

“It isn’t fair!” he stamped his foot, and our body followed suit. Feeling someone move the body for you never gets easier, I can tell you that. But you do learn to let it happen, lest the kid decide to do some real damage to our life. Like the time Lilith— well…

“You’ll trigger her out,” Twi said. “Calm yourself. Remember: he’s six years old. Be the parent.”

I ran a hand through my wiry, pink hair, took a deep breath, and counted to ten. We were never good with kids; doubly so when they were voices in our head. But there I was, hand on the shoulder of this… _figment of my imagination_, trying to buy into what the workbooks and my plural friends said to do.

I became his parent.

“We talked about sharing time today, Potts. Did you miss the meeting?”

The kid kicked at the floor. “Yeah, it’s boring. There aren’t any video games or anything fun like that when you’re working.”

“That’s why they call it work, kiddo!” I laughed—really laughed, right here over the keyboard!—and leaned in close. “You know we have to share time, right, kiddo?”

“Yeah. But it’s never enough.”

Six years old and already angry at time. They grow up so fast.

The kid wasn’t going to budge. I know this about him because I _am_ him, in a very real and totally-not-crazy way. We’re all stubborn as mules in mud.

So instead, I tried a different tack: empathy. “Remember how you got to cook yesterday?”

Potts struck a dramatic pose in his ears and tail. “It was nacho pot pie, yeah! It was messy and fun.”

“Do you think it’s fair to give some time to me today, knowing I’ll have just as much fun writing as you did cooking yesterday?”

“I mean, I guess...”

“Listen: I _promise_ you’ll get to cook dinner today at the very least. I’ll be an hour at most. Promise.”

His eyes lit up. _He trusts me. Finally._ “Okay okay! I’m gonna play pinball and y’all have fun writing your stupid boring adult stuff and just let me know when I can write my cool part okay bye!”

It worked. There was no breakdown, no heavy breathing, no heart palpitations. Just me, alone in the front, the voices finally silent enough for me to focus.

_It worked._

“No shit it worked,” Lilith said. “You just treated him like a little human being. That’s all.”

“It just feels strange. He’s a part of me, and I’m a part of him, but when I try to think like him things—”

“—Get blurry. Yeah. Tell me about it.”

Lilith leaned on my shoulder to read.

“It’s not crazy,” she snapped.

“I never said such a thing, Lilith.”

“But you were thinking it up there,” she continued, pointing to a spot a few paragraphs back. “Right there, round the time you calmed Potts down. ‘Totally-not-crazy.’ Your words, not mine.”

“We talked about this. Everyone in the system gets to tell the story their way.”

She threw up her hands in frustration.

“Okay, okay. I’m sorry, Addie, for trying to remind you that you’re not the only one here anymore, but holy Christ! Remember what the specialist said about trusting the system and letting us experience emotions instead of trying to logic your way out of—”

“—Lilith, there are no buts in an apology—”

“—Admitting it. To yourself. That you’re scared.” She crossed her arms. “Sorry, had to finish there. Go on, Addie.”

Just like that, Lilith was gone, and I had sweet silence once again.

Rolling my eyes, I stood up from the bar and walked toward the windows. Outside the barcade’s windows, you could see the vast, sprawling indoor city inside my head, whose architecture made no sense and whose corridors consisted of reminders of the past: the colors, the texture of shag carpet, the chill of fresh-packed snow on uneven sidewalks. Imagine an endless convention center in the middle of a bustling city, with as many mysterious nooks and crannies to explore as you could possibly imagine, and you can start to picture the arcade.

“_Our_ arcade,” Lilith reminded me. “You know we can hear you ruminating, right?”

Lilith flashed me this huge smile. I flipped her off. “I’m going for dramatic tension here! _Please_ give me room to cook!”

“Are we cooking?” Potts said.

“_Not now_, Potts,” I grumbled. 

“Maybe you and I could cook later,” Lilith said. “We could go out and get chicken wings and have a sauce-it-yourself buffet—”

“Do _not_ encourage him!” I stammered. “Off with you both, now!”

“Listen, all I’m saying is, if you want dramatic tension, you’re gonna have to talk about the Bad Stuff.”

I sat, dumbfounded at my other self’s lack of tact. (That’s how I know it’s real, by the way; leave it to an alter to always surprise you.)

She flung her arms wide. “What? Come on, Twi. You wanted to cook, so let’s cook!”

“…Twi literally just described our suicide attempt.” I stammered.

“No. That’s not the real Bad Stuff and you know it.” She leaned in closer. “It’s the symptom, not the _cause_.”

“Is that a Rocky Horror reference?” I said, and Lilith’s righteous anger gave way to a chuckle.

“…Maybe. The joke kind of got away from me, honestly. But remember: we’re going to have to talk about it eventually.”

We looked around the arcade, down at the well-worn floors, up at the tin ceiling tiles. We looked to anything but each other, hoping the tension would go away.

We sat in silence for what felt like forever.

“I should probably let you get back to it,” Lilith said.  

“That would be for the best, yes.”

“Sorry. I did it again, didn’t I?”

I sighed. “It’s okay. Just… just give me space next time, OK? That’s all I ask.”

She nodded and slipped from my attention. I tensed my hands into fists, relaxed, and breathed:

one,

two,

three—

The real world, once blurry and distant with dissociation, snapped into too-clear focus. The voices died down and, for a brief, wonderful moment, I had the body to myself.

And here we are, page ## of this memoir and we’re just now talking about the real world.

I pushed away from the desk and stretched while I reoriented. Outside the arcade, we live in a small lakeside condo in Chicago, and our writing desk faces the lake. I could hear the gentle wash of lake surf down on the beach below. (And yes, it’s that beach. -Twi) We’ve been married to our wife D long enough to need to do the math when someone asks for a number.

This disorientation—the whole process of regaining control of the body and being present in reality—is what we call switching. It’s sort of like I just woke up from a wonderful nap: energized, yes, but with no clue what’s going on. As far as I’m concerned, I go to sleep and wake up to someone else having written the intro I wanted to write.

This is what life with uncontrolled DID is like: where dream logic trumps memory, and the past and present meld into an amalgam of timeless, flashbulb moments. We are one, and yet each of us is our own island of experiences and memories. Discovering each other nearly killed us, and yet here we are—existing, a mess of a multiple stumbling around in the dark like, well, a blind person.

Which yes, we’re getting to that too.

When I finished the intro section (and chased a literal child away from controlling the body mid-draft), I drifted back into the inner world. It’s not exactly real, but it's where we go when we're not running the body.

As Addie mentioned, it’s a giant arcade here. Usually, we write in the cozy pub Potts runs, with musicals always playing on stage and smiling faces everywhere to lift spirits.

Each of us has our own safe space inside: Sam's beach, my suburban house filled with musical instruments, and the kids' treehouse around a campfire that never goes out. Each spot is built to contain and shield us from the pain of the Bad Stuff—

Sam’s bright voice interrupted my thoughts. “I don’t see why we’re writing this.”

“Because I’m a writer,” I replied. “It’s what I do.”

“But we haven’t published in years. And those books were niche furry romances. This memoir has to compete in the real world—we aren't good enough for that.”

"Maybe this could change that," I said quietly. "If we write it down together, lay everything out—warts and all—maybe we break the writer’s block. Maybe it helps us make sense of everything. Or maybe I just need it out of our head so it stops poisoning us."

Sam flipped her long, brown hair dismissively. “I think it’s a stupid idea.” She turned away.

## Sam, 2024

I slid behind the bar, squared up with Twi, and watched him. He was oblivious, adorable, completely absorbed in his memoir—the self-important dear. Cross-legged on a stool, he leaned so close to the laptop I thought I'd catch his nose in it if I closed the lid.

I leaned over in my red satin dress, my chin-length bob perfectly framing my pert smile—an invitation equally playful and enticing. I even wore full makeup, knowing Twi appreciated the effort.

I gently lifted his chin. He jumped, startled.

“Honey! You should knock first!” He glanced nervously toward the door. Typical Twi, worried what others might think of us.

“Oh hush,” I said, tracing my finger along his keyboard. "I'm just here to—"

My finger traced his delicate frame. His body relaxed, lips softening to pillows, awaiting mine. Instead, I kissed his forehead and placed a finger gently against his lips.

"—lighten the mood."

That was my role: The Flirt, The One Who Doesn't Remember Childhood. My job was sustaining romantic connections, maintaining our marriage, and mastering pinball. Tough work in our trauma-rich system, but I'd grown accustomed.

Twi and I also dated in our head. It was complicated; we didn't discuss it in therapy or fully understand it ourselves. It was simply inevitable, like gravity.

“You can’t be serious, Twi. Starting with suicide?” My voice dripped honey and sarcasm above the arcade’s din.

Twi clutched his loose, off-the-shoulder knit, anxiety edging into his features. “Yeah. The memoir needs a strong start. Last rejection said as much.”

"I can distract you,” I purred.

“No, Sam. Not after writing about that.”

“Oh.”

“You weren’t there,” he said quietly. “You can’t understand.”

I could, though. I had been there too—but hated dwelling on it. Before he sensed it, I snatched the laptop and sprinted away.

“I’ve got a great idea for my part! Be right back!”

He chased me through the buzzing arcade corridors. “Opposite Emotional Action!” I shouted over my shoulder. “Doctor’s orders—I’m performing happiness!”

I darted upstairs into a hall of apartments, slamming my bedroom door just before Twi caught up. Collapsing onto my bed, I locked the door. Twi’s frustrated knocking followed.

“Let’s put on some night music.” The speaker filled my room with “Last Midnight” from _Into the Woods_. Broadway posters, a canopy bed draped in pink silk, and a beloved, worn spinet piano—imperfect yet beautiful.

Settling at the writing desk, I watched the real world through a wall-mounted TV (installed to help with memory). My fingers tapped away at the laptop, bringing my thoughts to the page.

The inner world was tough to describe. Part intentional imagination, part spiritual refuge, it felt genuine to me. It was our sanctuary—our home, our survival tool, our sacred space.

From here, if I saw someone intriguing on the outside monitor, I’d dash downstairs and push aside whoever was driving to seize control—

Twi’s voice thundered through the door. “Are you actually writing, Sam, or staring at your navel? It’s a memoir, not your private journal.”

“You wrote your part, I’ll write mine!”

“History, Sam. High notes only. No thirsty fanfiction.”

“Marvelous trust, dear.” I sighed. “Fine.”

The truth was, Twi didn’t fully grasp our involvement during the suicide attempt. He called it a "scare," too afraid to label it clearly. We all supported him, silently, unseen.

Before that night, we’d spent weeks white-knuckling through sobriety and starvation diets, feeling like failures after backsliding. An especially dissociated alter took that relapse as a sign to end it.

Life wasn’t easy then: quitting alcohol cold-turkey, hosting guests, little privacy. It wasn't for lack of planning—just extremely bad luck.

(We’ve battled suicidal urges since age thirteen, with countless safety nets. Every contingency failed that night.)

“Just the facts,” Twi said.

We grew up in a tiny Indiana town, small enough to know everyone’s secrets, dull enough that gossip became entertainment. My family had lived there generations—teachers knew parents, sheriffs shared beers in our yard. Few people of color; those who arrived didn’t stay long.

I—Sam, specifically—didn't exist until college. Once out, I vowed never to return. That's why I narrate this part: I'm distanced enough to share without being triggered.

In college, unnoticed, I took control for a semester. I dated a trans girl, explored my gender at neighboring campuses, joined queer theater circles. Still, openly coming out felt impossible, dangerous.

After graduation, a disastrous attempt at teaching high school English broke us. We fled our girlfriend, moved into the trans community, and began transitioning. Life became hopeful again. For the first time, we didn't want to die. Slowly, we rebuilt ourselves.
## Lilith, 2024

Then my family dumped me.

Of course it was about being trans. "What will the town think?" Mom asked. "I don't think it's right," Dad said. Occasionally, he still let me visit—provided I gave enough warning so my nieces and nephews wouldn’t see the "monster" I'd become.

Mom dropping me hurt deeply. We’d spoken daily; becoming an abomination in her eyes cut to my core. For two years, I left voicemails, emails, desperate attempts to win her love back. Silence.

Over fourteen years, I saw her four times: once to dissuade me from surgery, once to meet my wife, once attempting reconciliation, and finally at an aunt’s graduation party. During the pandemic, I reached out again. Some wounds never heal.

Indiana proved toxic for trans life—jobs wouldn't hire me despite qualifications. So, I moved us to Chicago. We found work, met our wife, bonded with chosen family, published novels, and bought a condo. Ordinary adult milestones felt extraordinary because we finally weren’t fighting to exist.

For the first time, I could just _live._

Life turned good—really good. Comfortable, safe, invisible in the anonymity of a large city. Then the pandemic hit, trapping us inside our mind and exposing fractures we never knew existed.

## Sam, 2024

I think that about covers it. Like Twi said, memory is tricky for us. We tried to keep things orderly, but that's life as a system. Expect abuse, pizza, time travel, furries, and a hint of the Bad Stuff halfway through. It’s been a wild ride.

Ultimately, that’s Single Player Co-Op for you—buckle up.

## Potts, 2019

After the suicide attempt, I went into therapy to control my drinking and learn self-love.

The early pandemic months improved things. Without social drinking pressure, my habits improved. I hired a personal trainer, and soon, I was waking early for tea and meditation. Imagine that, if you can handle a "live-laugh-love" vibe.

Even better, I reconnected with my mother after fourteen years of separation due to my transition. In 2019, we met face-to-face to catch up.

At this point, I believed there was only one "me"—which shouldn’t surprise you, given this is a memoir about DID. Sure, I had ongoing dialogues with characters from my novels, but I assumed that's how writers worked. Didn't everyone have a chorus inside, clamoring for attention? It explained my inconsistent moods, interests, and productivity perfectly.

Career-wise, I thrived, securing a significant raise and leadership role at a larger company. The increased stress seemed normal—part of professional growth.

Then came the spark: my sister Whit’s unexpected call on a lovely Saturday in late summer 2020. Still warm, but with autumn in the air. My wife, wrapped burrito-style in blankets, protested sleepily as I reached for the phone.

"Leave it and come back to bed," D murmured. "Everyone can wait."

"It's Whit," I said.

D paused. "Really?"

"Yeah, it must be important."

"Okay, honey."

When I answered, Whit’s excitement crackled through the line, her breath tight with anticipation.

"You'll never guess what happened," she started.










## Lilith, 2019

Whit and I have beef—the kind that's been ground up and served cold. Since around 2000, I'd learned to censor myself around her and the family.

My family hadn't earned my openness since the late '90s. My entire adult life had been carefully planned around distancing myself from our hometown. I kept interactions brief and controlled: no loans from Dad, no casual introductions between Mom and girlfriends. Still, we maintained superficial ties—calls, occasional visits, holiday appearances. But my transition was the breaking point.

Mom hated how I'd handled it. Dad tolerated it quietly. Whit felt forced to choose sides. Suddenly, I was alone—holidays reduced to microwaved meals and cheap vodka. Strangely, I found comfort in avoiding holidays altogether. Something about them always triggered deep panic.

Then, Whit called with news that changed everything. Dad had been accused of molesting a child. I felt a rush of twisted joy, vindication mixed with disbelief. But when I hung up, something terrifying happened: my voice and body moved without my control.

"He's finally getting caught!" I said, fist pumping, unable to stop myself.

D sat up. "What's going on?"

"My dad's finally caught! He can't hurt me anymore!" The words spilled out uncontrollably as I inserted myself into the unfolding drama, making frantic calls like a gossip-hungry neighbor.

I'm ashamed that my reaction prioritized my own trauma over the victim's experience. But this memoir demands honesty, even when it exposes my worst moments. That incident marked the beginning of the cracks splitting open—the moment I realized I wasn't alone in my head.

## Twi, 2024

Writing a memoir as multiple people sharing one life is surreal. Consider our fragmented therapy history: 2007 (attempted bipolar diagnosis), 2003 (hormones through university counseling), 1997 (lying to a middle-school counselor), 2013 (depression and panic attacks), 2016 (depression), 2018 (PTSD). None of these efforts worked—we couldn't even recall week-to-week sessions.

(This paragraph alone required thirty real-time minutes of internal negotiation—our amnesia runs deep.)

Our life emerges in snapshots, confusing memories that often feel secondhand. Once, while sharing trauma with an old friend, I thought I was revealing something new—only to hear I'd told him twelve years earlier. Or realizing I had driven a tech club from another university to invest heavily in a project I barely remembered.

These memories flash like distant lightning, visible only when the storm inside quiets enough to let me see clearly.
