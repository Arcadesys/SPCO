# Unemployment
## The year we had nothing to do

*After the managed-out year. We learned to actually live together. AI fixed our memory gaps. Time cured my disadvantage in blindness.*
[Epigraph rhythm: four short beats, each a thesis. Strong. "Managed-out" and "nothing" will echo in Ch 1–2—use that call-back deliberately.]

---

### 1. The lie

Write the layoff. Your boss lied to your face about what was happening. What did they say? What actually happened? The moment you knew it was a lie. The betrayal as the break between "managed-out job" and "nothing." Relief and terror both. ~800–1.2k words.
[Rhythm: question-question-question then declaratives—punchy. "Relief and terror both" lands. Echo "managed-out" and "nothing" from epigraph.]

---

### 2. The first week

The job is gone. No structure. Who gets up? Who applies? Who dissociates? The fear of "we have to find a job" vs "we have nothing to do but be us." Set the void that the next six months will fill. POV: Addie. ~800–1.2k words.
[Repetition: "nothing" again—good, anchors the section title. "Six months" enters here; it recurs in 3–7, 10. Consider naming it once ("the void"?) and then just "it" or varying: "that stretch," "those months."]

### 3. Monk mode

You threw yourself into learning AI and software dev for six months. Like a monk with a mission, dialed in. You were also writing this book. Give concrete details: what you studied (AI, dev), when you wrote, how the days looked. One or two specific moments — a late night, a breakthrough, a routine. Not vague; this is the named phase. ~1.5–2.5k words.
[Rhythm: "Like a monk with a mission, dialed in" — tight, visual. " concrete"/"specific" appear here and in 4, 5—vary the instruction or consolidate. "One or two specific moments" vs 5's "One concrete day or week" vs 4's "Pick one specific tool"—repetition of "one [adjective] [noun]" framing.]

---

### 4. AI as external memory

In that same six months, AI fixed our memory gaps. Pick one specific tool or workflow: daily log, "what did I do today?" prompt, shared notes that survive switches. What did you use? How did it feel to have a record that outlasted amnesia — the weirdness of reading your own life in third person? ~1–1.5k words.
[Direct epigraph callback: "AI fixed our memory gaps." "In that same six months" — clear temporal bridge from 3. "reading your own life in third person" is a sharp, memorable image. Consider cutting "Pick one specific" and just "One tool or workflow" to avoid "one X" pile-up.]

---

### 5. Learning to live together

In the six months the only "project" besides AI, dev, and the book was being a system. One concrete day or week: who did what, how you handed off, one conflict and how it got resolved. "We learned to live together" in scene. POV: Potts or Addie. ~1.2–1.8k words.
[Epigraph callback: "We learned to actually live together." Strong. Repetition: "In the six months" again; "One concrete day or week" echoes 3–4's framing. Vary: "Anchor in a single day (or week)" or "Ground it in one day." POV: Addie has been primary in 2, 7, 8; consider giving Potts more weight here for variety.]

---

### 6. Blindness: time, not cure

No big event — the accumulation. Cane routine, VoiceOver default, asking for help without shame (or with less). "Time cured my disadvantage" = adaptation, not healing. You had time to integrate it instead of performing abled at work. POV: Max or Twi. ~1–1.5k words.
[Epigraph callback: "Time cured my disadvantage in blindness." Direct. Rhythmic contrast: "No big event — the accumulation" sets the tone (slow build, not drama). "performing abled at work" is sharp. Max/Twi POV breaks the Addie-heavy run—good for reader variety.]

---

### 7. D during the six months

How did D respond? Fear, patience, boundaries. "We're not okay but we're not dying." One conversation or ritual. POV: Addie or Sam. ~800–1.2k words.
["Six months" again—could trim to "D during that stretch" or "D in the void" to vary. "One conversation or ritual" = another "one X" frame. "We're not okay but we're not dying" — strong, memorable. Terse prompt; consider whether the brevity serves (intimate, loaded) or flattens (needs more scaffolding).]

---

### 8. First interview

You were handed a document the moment the interview began. No prep, no warning. A four-page, 12-point PDF of context. Your nightmare. And you were only allowed pen and paper — your worst enemy. Write the scene: what they handed you, what you could or couldn't do, how it felt. POV: Addie (or whoever fronted). ~600–1k words.
[Rhythm: "No prep, no warning" — two beats. "Your nightmare. And you were only allowed pen and paper — your worst enemy." — escalation lands. Temporal shift: we leave "the six months" here; this is the break back into job-seeking. Shorter word count (600–1k) matches the single-scene focus—structure and length align.]

---

### 9. Second interview

An old friend put you up for the position. You told them you couldn't see well enough to do a test in normal time limits. They interviewed you, hired you. You're now in the best job of your life; you move the needle every day. Write it: the ask, the response, the hire, and what "best job / move the needle" means now. ~800–1.2k words.
[Structural mirror: 8 = nightmare interview, 9 = the one that worked. Contrast in tone and outcome. "Write it" echoes "Write the scene" (Ch 1, 8)—minor repetition. "the ask, the response, the hire" — three beats, clean. Consider varying "Write it" to "Ground the arc in: " or similar to avoid imperative pile-up.]

### 10. Turning point / Bridge to "for now"

We're not going back to who we were. Living together (and the book, and the learning) is the job now. Unemployment ended. The captain's wheel, the cabin, the grill — this is what came after. POV: Addie or Twi. ~600–1k words.
[Epigraph payoff: all four beats (living together, AI, time, blindness) have been paid off. "The captain's wheel, the cabin, the grill" — concrete sensory anchors, three beats; let them land. "Unemployment ended" — declarative, final. Rhythm: short sentences carry weight. Consider whether "for now" in the title wants a beat in the prose—the provisional, the not-fixed-forever.]
