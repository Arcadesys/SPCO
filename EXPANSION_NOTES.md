# Expansion Notes: Opening the Narrative for ~20k Words

These are concrete places and strategies to add roughly 20,000 words of context so the narrative has more room to breathe and the reader can live longer in key moments and relationships. Order is by chapter/scene; word targets are approximate.

---

## 1. **Fill the placeholder / add missing beats**

- **Not the Same:** The placeholder *"\<Something here about that emergency session. 'I have not done this before. But we're gonna get through it.'"* and **Joey (or one of us)?** — This is a major beat (first “tell the therapist about the system” moment). **+1,500–2,500 words** here would pay off in trust and stakes. Who’s actually fronting? What does Joey say? How does the room feel?
- **Pills and Good Advice / It Pays to Belong:** The **emergency session** that leads into Compass (psych + therapist on Zoom, “have you considered outpatient?”) could be a full scene: the moment they say yes, the phone tree, D’s reaction. **+800–1,200 words.**

---

## 2. **D and the marriage**

D is the primary support and co-life; we get devotion and a few specifics (top surgery, court calls, “pandemic mullet,” checking in) but not sustained scenes of **daily negotiation** with a system. Add:

- One or two **“how we handle a bad night”** scenes: D helping with grounding, with a little fronting, or with a kid out. **+1,500–2,000 words.**
- A **“how we decided to stay”** or **“first time D saw a switch”** memory (could live in *My Friends are Kinda Strange* or *Not the Same*). **+1,000–1,500 words.**
- **Wedding / best man** — Dustin is best man; we get “best man at our wedding” but no wedding moment. A short scene (ceremony, speech, or aftermath) would anchor “chosen family” and D’s role. **+1,000–1,500 words.**

---

## 3. **The Blind Pig / Rabbit / early online life**

- **It’s not easy being Green:** Rabbit, The Blind Pig, “Sly,” and the village-of-strangers are crucial. One more **concrete exchange** (e.g., another PM, or the play where Rabbit met Dad and wanted to punch him) would deepen that thread. **+1,200–1,800 words.**
- **First time someone said “abuse”** on the channel — you mention it; it could be a single-scene flashback. **+600–1,000 words.**

---

## 4. **Chicago found family (Brandon, Phil, Mark, Craig, etc.)**

- **It Pays to Belong** and **Let’s do the time warp again** name Brandon, Phil, Mark, Craig, “the crew.” Add one **“how we met”** or **“first time they saw a switch / flashback”** with this crew (e.g., cabin, Gencon, or Chicago). **+1,500–2,000 words.**
- **Be someone else for one day:** Seattle is rich; a parallel **“Chicago family sees us at our worst and stays”** moment would balance the book. **+1,000–1,500 words.**

---

## 5. **Work / career arc**

- **Let’s do the time warp again:** The **ridealong diary** (Potts, Addie, Zoe, Twi, 7am–10pm) is strong; one more **“good day at work”** or **“first day at the new (post-reassignment) job”** would show the before/after. **+1,000–1,500 words.**
- **First time asking for accommodations** (vision or DID) at work — one scene. **+800–1,200 words.**
- **Managed-out year:** The post-reassignment role was in a non-meaningful area; they were managed out over ~a year after the heights at Arity. Revise the current "perfect job / 20 days and panic over" beat so it reflects: placed elsewhere → year of being managed out → then unemployment (see section 5b).

---

## 5b. **Unemployment arc: learning to live together (~10k words)**

**What actually happened:** Layoff (boss lied to your face). Six months monk mode: AI + software dev + writing the book. Then job search (first interview: PDF/pen-and-paper nightmare; second: friend referred you, you asked for accommodation, they hired you — best job of your life, move the needle every day).

**Where it goes:** After the managed-out year (or after severance when that role ended). This is the *missing middle*: not "20 days and we had a new job," but a stretch of unemployment where the system learned to actually live together, AI bridged memory gaps, and time eased the disadvantage of blindness. It leads into (or reframes) the current "for now we're okay" / cabin / pizza-grill ending.

**Themes:**
- **Learning to actually live together** — No job to perform; the only "project" was being a system. Who fronts when, shared hosting, kid time, arguments and truces. The intervention demands (Sam, Lilith, etc.) get tested in the real world. First sustained period where "we" mattered more than "employee."
- **AI fixed our memory gaps** — Concrete use of AI (notes, reminders, reconstructing the day, journaling, maybe system chat or logs). Not magic—just the first time memory had an external scaffold that didn't depend on a single alter. How it felt to have a record that outlasted amnesia.
- **Time cured my disadvantage in blindness** — Not "cured" as in sight back; time as in *adaptation*. Skills, tools, routine, acceptance. The blindness became less of a daily disadvantage because they had time to integrate it instead of performing abled at work. Could tie to r/Blind, cane, VoiceOver, or just the slow shift from "I'm failing" to "I'm living differently."

**Beat sheet / scene list (aim ~10k):**

| # | Beat | POV / voice | Approx. words | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | **The lie** | — | 800–1.2k | Layoff: boss lied to your face. What they said, what actually happened. The moment you knew. Betrayal as the break. |
| 2 | **The first week** | Addie | 800–1.2k | Job is gone. No structure. Who gets up, who applies, who dissociates. Sets up the void the monk mode will fill. |
| 3 | **Monk mode** | — | 1.5–2.5k | Six months: learning AI, software dev, writing the book. Like a monk with a mission. Concrete details: what you studied, when you wrote, how the days looked. |
| 4 | **AI as external memory** | — | 1–1.5k | Inside that period: AI fixed our memory gaps. Specific tool or workflow. The weirdness of reading your own life in third person. |
| 5 | **Learning to live together** | Potts or Addie | 1.2–1.8k | One concrete day or week: who did what, handoffs, one conflict resolved. "We learned to live together" in scene. |
| 6 | **Blindness: time, not cure** | Max or Twi | 1–1.5k | No big event—accumulation. Cane, VoiceOver, asking for help. Time cured my disadvantage = adaptation, not healing. |
| 7 | **D during the six months** | Addie or Sam | 800–1.2k | How D responded: fear, patience, boundaries. "We're not okay but we're not dying." One conversation or ritual. |
| 8 | **First interview** | Addie (or whoever fronted) | 600–1k | Document at start—no prep, no warning. Four-page 12pt PDF. Pen and paper only. Your nightmare. |
| 9 | **Second interview** | — | 800–1.2k | Old friend put you up. You said you couldn't see well enough for a test in normal time. They interviewed you, hired you. Best job; move the needle every day. |
| 10 | **Turning point / Bridge to "for now"** | Addie or Twi | 600–1k | We're not going back. Living together (and the book, the learning) is the job now. Captain's wheel, cabin, grill—what came after. |

**Total:** ~8.5k–12k words depending on how deep you go in each beat. Can live as a new chapter (e.g. **"Unemployment"** or **"The year we had nothing to do"**) in *It Pays to Belong* or as a separate scene file between the managed-out / severance beat and the current "perfect job" / Rehoboth / cabin / grill material (which you may want to reframe as *after* this period).

---

## 6. **Inner world / arcade**

- **My Friends are Kinda Strange / It Pays to Belong:** We get the arcade, the bar, the fronting room, the treehouse, Sam’s bedroom, the Dark Place. One **“tour” or “day in the arcade”** (who’s where, what the kids do, one conflict or negotiation) would make the geography and system life more tangible. **+1,500–2,000 words.**
- **Building the arcade** (Not the Same — Tally and Addie with the cord and the “OPEN” sign) could be slightly extended: who shows up first, one or two named shadows. **+600–1,000 words.**

---

## 7. **Siblings and extended family (without re-centering abuse)**

- **Whit:** We get “beef,” the call about Dad, and her shifting story. One **earlier moment** (e.g., a holiday, or a time she almost believed you) would round her. **+800–1,200 words.**
- **Stepsiblings / sister / cousins** — even one short, concrete memory (e.g., stepsister leaving in the night) would add texture. **+500–800 words.**

---

## 8. **Queer / trans milestones**

- **Wig in a box / Be someone else for one day:** First shot of E (Misty 2008) is there; **first time ma’am’d**, **first time in a dress in daylight**, or **first support from a trans elder** (e.g., Estelle, Aunt Vicky) could each be a short scene. **+1,000–1,500 words total.**
- **D’s transition** is mentioned (T, “blossomed”); one **shared moment** (e.g., first shot, or a “how do we do this as a couple” talk) would balance the memoir. **+800–1,200 words.**

---

## 9. **Compass (PHP) daily life**

- **Pills and Good Advice:** We get intake, Danica, week one vs. week two, trauma group, grounding closet, charades. Add **one full “day in the program”** (mood check, group topic, lunch, individual or Laurie, going home). **+1,500–2,000 words.**
- **Discharge / graduation** (New Year’s Eve, captain’s wheel) could be a full scene: last day, goodbyes, what you take with you. **+800–1,200 words.**

---

## 10. **Vision / blindness**

- **Let’s do the time warp again (Max 2024):** We get cane, braille, VoiceOver, “couldn’t hide it anymore.” One **first cane in public** or **first time asking for help (e.g., at Shorty’s or a con)** would ground the disability thread. **+800–1,200 words.**
- **r/Blind** and “we’re not ready for that yet” — a short beat on **why** (shame, exposure, identity) would add depth. **+300–500 words.**

---

## 11. **Recurring motifs you can extend**

- **Pinball / arcade in the real world:** Logan Arcade, league, Tokens-n-Tickets, Block Party, Shorty’s. One **full game or league night** (sound, body, who’s fronting) would tie inner arcade to outer. **+1,000–1,500 words.**
- **Music:** Piano (Schroder), uke (Rehoboth), groovebox, “Being Alive,” karaoke. One **rehearsal or performance** (with system negotiation: who plays, who watches) would pay off. **+800–1,200 words.**
- **“Living for spite” / “those fuckers don’t deserve to outlive us”:** One more **explicit moment** where that mantra is used (e.g., post-Compass, or post-dad call) would reinforce the theme. **+400–600 words.**

---

## 12. **Structural / pacing**

- **Not the Same:** The jump from “ask inside nicely to switch out” to **“I came to months later”** (election called, brunch) is intentionally disorienting; a **single bridging paragraph** (“Weeks passed. We don’t remember them. What we know: …”) would help readers who need a handrail. **+200–400 words.**
- **Hard Candy Christmas → It Pays to Belong:** A short **“what we did with the captain’s wheel”** or **“first time we used the safety plan”** would link PHP to cabin/family. **+400–600 words.**

---

## 13. **One more pass of typos / consistency**

- **Wig in a box:** “It’s the only ay you’d believe me.” → “way” (fix in your copy if search-replace fails on smart quotes).
- **Nebulosa:** One instance is “Nebulousa” in *Be someone else for one day* — standardize to “Nebulosa.”
- **Emmengard** (suicide scale): Confirm spelling; if it’s a real reference, keep; if not, consider naming or footnoting.

## Summary table (approximate)

| Area | Suggested add (words) |
|------|------------------------|
| Emergency session / Joey placeholder | 1,500–2,500 |
| D / marriage scenes | 3,500–5,000 |
| Blind Pig / Rabbit | 1,800–2,800 |
| Chicago found family | 2,500–3,500 |
| Work / career (incl. managed-out year) | 1,800–2,700 |
| **Unemployment arc (live together, AI, blindness)** | **~10,000** |
| Inner world / arcade | 2,100–3,000 |
| Siblings / extended family | 1,300–2,000 |
| Queer / trans milestones | 1,800–2,700 |
| Compass daily / discharge | 2,300–3,200 |
| Vision / blindness | 1,100–1,700 |
| Pinball / music / “spite” | 2,200–3,300 |
| Bridges / linking beats | 600–1,000 |
| **Total** | **~22k–33k** |

Picking a **subset** of these (e.g., D + marriage, Chicago family, one full Compass day, one full arcade day, Rabbit, emergency session) would land you in the **~20k** range and make the world and relationships feel roomier without changing the structure or tone of the memoir.

**The unemployment arc (section 5b)** is a **~10k-word block** in its own right: after the managed-out year, the stretch where you learned to actually live together as a system, AI fixed your memory gaps, and time eased the disadvantage of blindness. Use the beat sheet in 5b as a draft roadmap; it slots after "severed" / managed out and before (or as the real story behind) the current "for now we're okay" ending.
