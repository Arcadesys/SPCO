## Max, 1994
You ever wondered what time travel would be like? I don’t because I have been there and I have done that and I can tell you, it wasn't worth it.

So picture this. It was 1994. I was in the basement of my mom's house with a dingy old MS-DOS machine. It was a rainy mid-afternoon outside, and I could hear fat drops pattering on the half-window near the ceiling. The basement was a playroom of sorts: air hockey tables, dolls, nerf guns, costumes for dressing up and making plays and such.

But for me, the ocean-blue glow of the QBASIC screen was all the toy I needed. At the time I was working on an ASCII movie, I think, where I animated little text symbols to tell a story.

Upstairs, the yelling started. It was my mom yelling at my stepsisters. Again. I tried to block out the words - easier to have plausible deniability later if I was too busy to pay attention to the argument - but the shrill tone echoed through the kitchen, off the pantry, down the stairs, and then to my ears.

"You're worthless! How *dare* you treat your father like this?"

There was silence on the other end. There was always silence on the other end. It was always mom, screaming at two kids who couldn't muster a reply. I tried typing faster, harder, begging the buckling springs to drown out the sound, but mom was too loud, too piercing.

"I don't want you ungrateful kids in my home!"

I focused on the wall. Mom had a thing about splatter paint. Really any sort of craft with paint was her home turf. The walls of the basement had this coat of white paint with splatters of black and light charcoal that swirled, struck, and slashed their way behind the computer desk. I traced some of the lines and tried to go away, somewhere, anywhere but here—

"Aww, are you gonna cry and call your Mommy now so you can bitch and moan about how evil I am?"

I didn't go upstairs. I never went upstairs. She'd yell at me the same way if I did. Instead my fingers traced the paint on the cinder-block walls: little whorls, long swipes, thin rails where I could imagine my finger was a tiny railcar riding and jumping across an endless series of tracks, far far away from the noise. There, warmed by the blue glow of code and the splatter-paint railroad tracks, I could lose myself in absurd logic and daydreams while the screaming went on and on.

## Addie, 2003

So if I’m being honest, I’m not entirely sure where I fit into the system.

I know I’ve been around since 2003 in one form or another. Maybe I was around before then, maybe I wasn’t. But when it comes to memories, the earliest one I can remember clearly is from November 2003: meeting my new best friend, Dustin Friend.

We met in my freshman year of college at a furry meetup at Purdue. It was our first time going out to meet other furs in person. I knew one, maybe two of the folks at this thing, and only in that sort of friends-of-friends way that made introductions awkward. But this was my big chance to make friends - isn’t that what you do in college? - and I wanted to come out of the gate swinging wide.

At the time the system was, uh, let’s just say very confused about things. Misty spent the first six months of school trying to express herself as a girl, and in the process got us into a bit of hot water at our all-male college. Leaving home left us exhausted, as decompressing from all the trauma we experienced was taking its toll.

The meetup took place in a student apartment belonging to a friend from the UAE who wooed us with Smash Brothers and obscure flavors of kit-kats from his home country. His girlfriend also wowed the system with lots of nerd trivia and an adorable cat. While I can’t tell you the names of all the people I met at that little party, the only thing I can remember for sure was my friend, Dustin Friend, playing endless rounds of Smash with me, as if the world around us faded into nothingness. We clicked together like jigsaw pieces, and as the night went on our conversation grew deeper and deeper. We left that party with plans to hang out as soon as humanly possible, even if it meant a 3 hour drive to his place in Northern Indiana to make it happen.

And the best part? Dustin was safe. Before we discovered our system that seemed like a given, but gosh. Twi knew any single slip-up at college could come back to haunt us: tell an acquaintance from the same hometown a little too much in passing and it’d make its way back through the small-town gossip tree to our parents. But Dustin? Dustin was from an entirely different part of the state! Nothing we confided in him had a chance of getting back to my parents.

I can’t overstate just how powerful that realization was for us.

It wouldn’t have happened with anyone else in the system. Potts would have kept his distance. Twi would have thought something was wrong. Sam… well, she might have slept with him that night. It had to be me, the boisterous and outgoing asexual alter, taking point that day.

Dustin and I got together at least once a month after that. With time and a lot of bravery I found my queer little tribe on campus and blossomed into a weekday socialite. Then, on the weekends, I’d finish class, hop in my bedraggled, blue Pontiac Sunbird, and drive the three hours to Rochester, IN for a weekend with Dustin.

Every weekend together, we played games. A lot of games.

I obsessed about pinball, he obsessed about Pac-Man. But we both loved to play Dance Dance Revolution, and the closest machine to him was Tokens-n-Tickets. So most weekends we’d squeeze in a few hours to travel to the arcade and get our game on.

We’d spend hours pumping quarters into their DDR machine. I swear, by the time he moved away from that town I had memorized every machine in that place by heart: Ikaruga near the back, Keyboardmania on the right as you walked inside, a pristine Captain Fantastic pin opened up to show its innards stored behind glass near the entrance. Upstairs, there was pizza, though we never bothered to eat there. (That was time we could have spent gaming, after all!)

Six hours round trip - seven, if you counted travel time to the arcade! - to hang with this dude. And we’d do this dance at least once a month. So when we say this guy knows us, he *really, really knows us.*

## Max, 1996

Blink.

It was 1996 and I was back at mom's house. The home was a lot quieter now. No yelling. Lots more laughter. Parties on the weekend, too. Real alcohol-fueled ragers. I was sitting on one end of an extremely-90s upholstered sectional, and mom sat on the other. She popped a beer in the silence that filled the room.

"They were just troublemakers," she says. "Aren't you glad they're gone?"

My words come out robotic. "Yes mom. they were just the worst."

I miss them. To this day, I miss them both. But I smiled and I said what I knew needed to be said because that's how you don't get abused at home.

## Addie, 2024

Sam slammed her beer glass down and stared at me with icy brown eyes.

“No, okay, seriously. who the fuck cares? You met a friend in college. So did every single other kid that ever set foot in a dorm. What’s next, telling everyone about how hard you studied for finals, or how he both got so drunk at a convention one night that he fell asleep under the hotel bathroom sink?”

I hook my head. “He’s not just anyone, honey. He was the best man at our wedding! And like I said before–”

“–You get to write your part your way, sure. But it’s not interesting. It’s not helpful. It’s not... I don’t know. Not proof that we’re a system, or some wild switching experience, or anything like that. I don’t care about this story and I live inside your head. Why should anyone care?”

“Look, I’m getting to it. honest. Twi’s not the only part in the system that knows how to write. Just trust me, okay?”

“This is why we stopped writing.” She scoffed and ordered another champagne, and I went back to the draft.

Back in Rochester, Indiana, we were going to bed in his little bedroom. I laid on a foam chair that unfolded out to a flat cushion he lovingly called the flippy-fuck. We should have been sleeping, but we were too excited;.so we stared at the ceiling and talked about nothing at all for hours.

It didn’t matter the subject; I just loved talking about… well, whatever we wanted, really. Games, life, love, our initial foray into meeting furries in the real world, and figuring out our queerness. There were no boundaries on our conversations, and no matter how weird I got, or how outside of the bounds of “normal” I was, he was there for me. Listening. Laughing with me, not at me.

A friend like this, for me, had never happened before. In spurts, maybe. I had a friend or few in high school who reached that level of trust. But they were never fully safe, you know? In a small town word travels fast, and I was far enough outside the norm, as a closeted, queer trans woman in a literal Klantown, that any tidbit of information would be premium gossip back home.
 
“I don’t know who I am,” I admitted to him. “Maybe I’m a boy, maybe I’m androgynous. Maybe I’m gay, maybe I’m straight. I just… I don’t know.”

I stared at the ceiling, dumbstruck at the words coming from my lips. I had never said the words out loud before. Sam? Sure. She was out loud and proud as an androgynous bi person on chat servers online, secure in her anonymity and the physical distance from any harm that information sharing could have.

But at that point, Dustin knew our friends both at college and back home. We’d hosted him many times for holidays and long weekends at my mom’s house. This all could have gone so badly if he slipped up and said he knew too much.

The world is a dangerous place when you grew up in a small-town gossip mill. Word (and consequences) travel fast there. But Dustin? I knew deep in my heart Dustin was safe. That he’d keep my secrets, and he’d love me even if I did change.

Dustin rolled over to meet my eyes. “You’d still be my friend.”

“It just terrifies me.”

“I know how you feel.”

“But you’d still like me?”

“You’re awesome,” he assured me. I believed him. The memory grew hazy for a moment. We were sleep-deprived, exhausted from too much DDR, and living a moment where everything was just perfect. No anger, no yelling, no fighting; just two people being vulnerable around each other, nothing to see here.

“Is that the sun?” he asked, pointing to the window. “Oh shit.”

“We just talked all night, didn’t we?”

We laughed as the grey dawn touched our face, and in that moment I knew this guy was going to be my best friend for life.

## Max, 2000

Blink.

It was the year 2000. I was in a different house this time - dad's, I think. After the divorce he had refinished a dingy pole barn into a home for us. I was alone in a bedroom that must have belonged to me, given all the books and gaming consoles and such. I was resting my elbows on sculpted carpet that left deep patterns on my arms when I lay there for a long time.

In front of me was an old CRT monitor and an open mid-size tower PC. There were burn marks on some of the parts because dad had bought things cheap at a fire sale. Said if I could build a computer from the mess, he'd let me do whatever I wanted with it. I remembered staring at black-and-grey command prompt screens for hours at a time, typing in DISKPART commands and crossing my fingers that this time would be the time Windows 98 finally decided to install.

I’d been at it for months by this point, but the reward was too sweet to give up on: a honest, genuine private space in this home. Even if it was virtual, I’d have a line to the outside while—

*Crash!*

Upstairs I heard yelling, dishes shattering, people wrestling for control. There was always noises like that from the upstairs living room, and the voices reverberated through the house thanks to the living room's vaulted, primer-coat-on-drywall, pole barn ceiling. I knew Potts and Twi grew up here, but this space wasn't my home. 

I started typing commands into the computer, working quickly as I could. I didn’t like staying here. Things got dangerous here.

I know it sounds rude in retrospect, but there were different "masks" I wore depending on which home I was in. For mom, I put on a jester's cap and acted as silly as I could, knowing that would get her praise. At Dad's, Twi and Potts had to make themselves as small a target as possible to avoid their ire. And these weren’t just fanciful moods, either; each mask had their own backstory, their own knowledge, their own _skills_, so that there could be no cross-pollination between the two homes.

Me being here wasn’t just uncomfortable; it was dangerous. If my stepmom got a hold of me and started screaming, I’d start crying, and that just makes things worse. So I redoubled my efforts on the PC, hoping I could fix Twi’s problem and go back inside my head.

These weren't my kind yelling people. When I heard yelling it meant people were too drunk at 2AM, but if I stepped back from the computer for a moment I could identify the voices and the emotions: dad, my stepmom, my stepbrothers, my sister. A fight had broken out. Something about dad putting his foot down and trying to lay down ground rules set one of my stepbrothers off. Maybe this was about a girlfriend, maybe it was some drama with their dad, maybe they were yelling about report cards or smoking at school, whatever. It wasn't something I wanted to know about in any case.

The computer. _The computer is all that matters_.

I was already a writer by this point, apparently. Twi had a secret folder on the family computer where he’d write out his fanfics. We had made contact with a few writing mentors who were helping us find our feet in longer form writing. Getting this computer set up would let us write longer, more intense things.

I don’t know why, but Twi gets a rush whenever we do this writing thing. Something about it gets him to let his hair down, you know? It’s apparently good - we’ve published a few pieces and been nominated for some awards - but he couldn’t do longer stuff like novels until we had a computer of our own to draft on.

_To feel safe on,_ he corrected me.

I was hungry, but there was a strong feeling inside of my body like I shouldn't eat, shouldn't drink. *We have to make weight for tomorrow's dual meet.* The voice wasn't coming from me but it was *of* me, if that makes sense. Hell, I don’t even know how to wrestle, but apparently someone in here is pretty good at it.

I promised the voice I wouldn’t snack. It felt relief.

I entered a command and watched progress bars for a while. I loved progress bars. You could just zone out and stare at them and the world went by a lot faster. I liked when things went fast. Fast meant you got to sleep sooner, that the house got quieter sooner.

Just a bit more work, I thought to myself. One or two more restarts. We could fix this. Just needed a few more tweaks to the PC and there we could have privacy.

My stepmom screamed for Twi with the Angry Voice and he knew better than to make her wait. My body jumped to its feet and sprinted to the closed bedroom door. The world blurred. The memory was no longer mine but I got the highlights.

I sat in a dark-stained, cherry wood chair. Above, an ornate cuckoo clock ticked away on the wall. There was an aquarium bubbling away in a corner of the room, and the sound to this day could put ice into my veins.

## Sam 2024

I put my champagne flute down and applauded.

“Okay, Addie. Fine. You’ve convinced me that Dustin is a cool dude. What next?”

“I don’t know.”

My head tilted. I blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Like, I know what happens next. And I do remember going to tons of cons with him, spending a summer together, meeting all sorts of new folks, and getting too drunk at too many crazy room parties with him to count. But then? Once we started to know and trust people? the memories get–”

“–Hazy.” I tilted my head in confusion. The words came from my mouth, but they weren’t mine.

Hazy. _Unreal_.

I lived in a dream through most of college. Then, after graduation, Dustin and I moved to Indianapolis. He and I lived in the same apartment complex and were attached at the hip. If I wasn’t at work, and if I wasn’t busy trying to make my relationship with my family work, I was over at his place playing games.

He - and Mike, and Steve, and all the other friends we had at that time - they were our rock. Stuff got weird and hazy around that time, but they supported us, and we supported them. When my local group imploded he invited me into his circle of local friends with open arms. Better - he shouted our praise to the rooftops when given the chance. I swear, best wingman ever.

The new friends didn’t see me as a burden to shoulder. No - I was amazing to them, just as every single one of them were to me. For the first time a friend group ceased being casual friends and become a family.

...oh gosh. A family. My family.

We were back in our arcade again. I expected Addie to flash me this shit-eating, joker-style grin, the kind of smile that followed a horrible pun. But instead, they reached across the table for my hands.

I... I hadn’t really taken the time to look at them before. I mean, really look at them, inside the arcade. Here they were sporting a bright pink undercut, silly glasses, and a Hawaiian shirt so loud that it could have been cited for a noise violation. They were short and lanky, with bright eyes, toned build, and the bright smile of a performer. Her mood was a coin-toss between “all business, all the time” and “let me put on a show that’ll wow everyone around us.” A class clown and an orator, both too gay to function and too queer to move out of your way, she held space in a way few of us could match.

But here, the way Addie pierced us with her sincere eyes? This was new.

“I figured out why I’m here,” Addie said to me. “Just now. And I wanted you out front so I knew you would hear it.”

I could feel my heart skipping beats, the body’s shoulders pulled taught with tension. She considered her words for a moment before giving my hands another squeeze.

“College is hazy for all of us, I think. There were a lot of us running around the headspace then, trying to keep things going. We all knew that if we screwed up, well, that was going to be that. No net.”

“We escape our family, or we die trying. There was never a middle ground.”

“Exactly. So we all did what needed to be done to get out, get safe. And that meant pushing down what we wanted to get what we needed.

“We were so used to having to watch every little thing we did, but with the furries, in those moments, with Dustin and the crew? we didn’t need that. And I think to some extent we didn’t want that baggage to bleed over when we made our first impressions. I could be new, different, better, if I just let the past be in the past. And, well.”

Addie gave my hands another squeeze. “If I didn’t let people find you, they couldn’t hurt you. And I’m so, so sorry that I pushed you down for all those years.”

“You did all of this to keep me safe?”

Addie looked to the ground. “Yup.”

“You found out the system existed and then locked me away for a decade.”

“To protect you, yes.”

“Some protection.”

“I never said it was a good explanation. You trust people. You let them into your heart, and when they get there they can start seeing the scars. I couldn’t let that happen.”

“Everyone has scars.”

“Not us!” They slapped the table. "Not to anyone on the outside! That’s how it starts, you know? You let someone see your flaws, that gives them a peek at your weaknesses. Then, they start prying at the edges. Little needling at first, testing the waters. But then the needling becomes berating, berating abuse, and then we’re right back to where we started.

“We - all of us - are here to protect you. And yeah, I went a bit overboard. But if it meant you wouldn’t get hurt, I’d pay the price gladly.”

I leaned close and hissed a whisper. “How many years do you think we lost like this? Wound up like an electrified solenoid, ready to pop at the slightest pressure? How many good times do you think we missed, how many good people we never grew close to?

“How much living did we _not_ do because of our past? I don’t want to think about it. But I want to be different now.”

## Max, 1996


Blink.

It was 1996 and I was in an arcade in some remote Indianapolis warehouse district. I was — ugh, I was wearing the *boy clothes* in this memory. Gods. Baggy cargo shorts and a graphic t-shirt. You'd have thought I was trying to disappear from the world when puberty hit. But whatever, yeah. As long as I didn’t think about the clothes it was an arcade. Nobody could have a bad time in an arcade!

So I imagined something new to wear in the memory and that made me feel better: pleated skirt and graphic tank top. Much better. I could do that with my memories, whenever I wanted. Something didn’t fit? Just imagine it away.

So we were at a place called Block Party, which was Blockbuster’s failed attempt at getting in on the mid-90s arcade boom. We were there with, well, what _will_ be family, eventually.  My stepbrothers were there, reserved, and trying their best to pull off the "whatever" teen look to seem cool. Me, I had got too many kids inside my head to show up at an arcade and _not_ act like a caffeinated four-year-old with a free play card in the arcade?

Come to think of it, my uncle was there. He loved arcades. He worked as a social worker or something and he knew the nice lady who helped me with vision stuff at school. I hadn’t seen him for many years because dad did something in the 90s that made them not like each other. (Something about sex probably.) But he was _here_, and he was paying a lot of attention to me and the other boys. It was nice to get his attention again.

I remembered being close to him growing up. Lots of overnights at his really cool house, which was full of games to play and things to do. He was also very nice to me, I think. But here he was kind of… standoffish, for some reason? Whatever. I was at an arcade and I got to play video games. That’s all I needed.

We waited at the bar for game cards while sitting on benches that looked like pinball flippers. Beyond the linoleum-lined pub was a large, carpeted ocean of arcade machines and pins, all there ready to be explored.

I was _vibrating_ with energy.

I was scared of my stepbrothers, I think. They hit me and said mean things to me and made me feel like I wasn’t good enough boy for their time. So when time came to go out and have fun I split off, hoping to enjoy the games by myself.

Here and now, where everyone was on their very best behavior, things were nice. There were lots of people there so nobody could yell at us. And it was the kind of place where I got left alone to do my own thing, and when I did my own thing nobody ever yelled at me, so that was nice.

My uncle Justy handed me a game card and before they could give me any lip I dove straight into that arcade ocean with reckless abandon.


## Max, 2022


Blink.

I was alone in a spacious room in a house I didn’t recognize. I could hear waves crashing over some shore I didn’t know. In front of me was a large, flat object that _must_ be a computer screen, but it's impossibly thin. How did they fit the electron guns into this thing, anyway?

The world felt smaller, somehow. Besides that, everything was just _off_. There was a glass rectangle by my hands that vibrated about once a minute - again, that impossibly crisp screen! - and the objects around me just seemed sleeker, smaller, better than what I had seen before. Some of the devices didn’t even have wires!

I got the idea to look down at my body and nearly passed out from shock. My hands patted down my chest, my crotch, my hips. Everything is not what I remember. They're softer. Nicer, in a way I couldn't quite put into words. Maybe... comfortable?

No. _Girly._ No more nasty boy body!

I checked the date: December 20, 2020. I grabbed the mouse - no ball inside anymore! - and dragged the cursor across this impossibly large screen to find a chat window. I knew it was the Cats even if I don't know how I know that.

"Hello?" I type. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

"You're new, I take it?"

"I think?"

"It's cool," Lexi responded. "You have DID. That means there's more than one of you inside your head. You're safe, you're in your home, and everything is cool. How old are you?"

"Uh..."

"In your mind," Lexi responded. "Like, are you an adult, a kid, or a teen?"

"In between kid and teen? Tween?" I laughed. Well, someone laughed. Probably the adults inside, gobsmacked at what I was saying on a chat with someone who was a total stranger to me.

"Nice. What's your name, kiddo?”

“Max,” I typed. “Like Maxine, but cooler.”

A big grin dug deep dimples into my cheeks.

“Well Max, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”  

“Thanks. I'm very confused, very excited, and more than anything I need a primer on the last twenty years of technology because this shit is blowing my _mind_ right now."


---- 


You get over the time travel eventually. Can't stay mad about missing 20+ years for the rest of your life, after all! And even though my body is pushing 40 I still feel like I'm 13, still dress like I'm 13, and I live for every compliment I get on my look. I got us through, and now I got to enjoy the fruits of that labor.

Some days, I still feel like I'm in that Block Party from our youth. But I realize now that no matter how big the dissociated ocean that separates us, we're all from the same arcades, the same base components, the same life.

We are time travelers, lost in a labyrinth of our own memory. But it’s nice to look back and see, sometimes, that things weren’t so bad.

## Addie, 2023

All the while, through all the system discovery, confusion, processing, and system negotiation, my job trudged on.

My job was supposed to be my stepping stone to the sweet life: making big bucks as an agile coach at an institutional level. subsidiary of a Fortune 100 company wanted an Agile Coach to help deliver better product. Pre-system discovery, I was a well-seasoned scrum master who came with multiple recommendations from many different industry leaders. The interview went well, and, shortly after the start of the pandemic, I accepted the new gig.

It was meant to be my big break; after I had one Agile Coaching job under my belt, the world would be my oyster. And I was good at it! I got moved around from team to team to help them improve, and things were great. I was envisioning a future with cushy, $200k+ jobs in some upscale consulting firm, and the path to that number seemed so, so easy in the pre-system days!

But then, one year into taking my shot at the new place, the system woke up. The future where I dreamed of cushy executive consulting gigs went up in smoke.

Even though I didn’t know it yet, my big-shot tech career began to end in September 2020, when the stress of work finally broke the system free.

My first boss and I got along wonderfully, even going so far as to make us feel at ease discussing our system issues openly. But as the months dragged on, and the chaos inside grew messier, our hold on “the rockstar employee” title began to slip. Even the simplest tasks, like “show up to work on time,” felt like herculean efforts. It started with missing meetings whenever syskids inside chose to throw a fit. Then: forgetfulness, a total lack of motivation, and that all culminated in a complete breakdown of my ability to get work done.

For the first time in my life, I was on the fast track to getting fired.


## Max, 2024

I don’t want to dwell on the sight stuff, but I think it’s important to know that while this was all going on I started losing my vision.

It started in November of 2022.

…that’s a lie. It started way back in 1986, when my family went to see Peter Pan at a drive-in and I couldn’t see a thing. It continued as I went from single vision lenses to bifocals, bifocals to progressives, progressives to low vision specialist gear. So yeah, I’ve known for years that going blind was going to happen with or without my permission.

But November 2022? Yeah. That’s when I couldn’t hide it anymore.

It started with a tough conversation with an optometrist, who said I was no longer able to drive at night. Then it was the retinal specialist, who agreed and referred me to a Lighthouse. (They’re an extension of the Lion’s Club that focuses on the blind and low vision community.) We talked about options for driving and options for navigating the world.

A month later, I had my first white cane and was immediately hooked. I hadn’t realized how much I craved sensory stimulation that my eyes couldn’t bring in, and the more I used the cane, the easier navigating the world got.

(Turns out, I’d been shoulder-checking light poles and tripping over potholes for years. I just forgot when it happened because we’re a system.)

A month after that, I was learning braille and VoiceOver as the text on screen started to blur to the point of uselessness. My world changed seemingly overnight, as I replaced sight-focused skills I built over years with blind-friendly actions.

Nothing changed. I was always a system and I always had low vision. But in 2023, those truths were tossed into a gigantic pressure cooker of stress that eventually exploded into a career crisis that almost ended our life.

Try as we might, we were, quite simply, not up to the task of pretending to be an abled adult human anymore. We tried - boy, did we _ever_ try! - but the ending is still the same.

Welcome to our fuckup arc.

### Sam, 7:00AM

My phone played uplifting, quiet music for my wakeup alarm. Not that I needed it in the summer, what with the sun coming up at five and the birds chirping at six, but I wanted some time to myself. I dreamed about getting up, making tea, listening to a record. Really coming to the day slowly, you know? But when I went to leave, my arms reached for Jack-Jack instead.

“No. Stay and snuggle.”

“Hi Lilith.” I forced myself to get up and walk to the bathroom.

“Work’s stupid. Stay in bed. Help the littles feel better.”

Then I was walking _back_ from the bathroom, having done nothing, so that I could pick up Jack-Jack, my newest stuffed animal. Never was a stuffie person before system discovery, but when you have a head full of kids, you end up with lots of stuffies.

As for the bathroom? Sometimes these conversations between, well, _mes_ are smoother when we can talk to each other through a mirror, like a proper crazy person should. The kid refused to let Lilith and I talk without his stuffie, so there I was, holding Jack-Jack’s bunny paw, listening to birdsong, and staring at a blurry face in the mirror that flashed childlike smiles and laughter to me whenever our eyes met.

My face snapped into sudden sternness. Lilith said, “You said the kids could watch Bluey last night.”

“Yeah, the night got away from me.”

Lilith wagged a finger at the mirror. “No, you got selfish. Zoe’s wanted to play that marble game for at _least_ 3 months now. Least you could do is throw on some Bluey for her.”

I looked at the time and pinched the bridge of my nose. Ten minutes before my first meeting, and we were already fighting— 

…wait. ten minutes? How the hell did two hours pass? I waved my fingers in front of my eyes to see if I was dreaming.

No such luck.

“What even happened last night?” I asked the mirror.

A new, calmer countenance washed over my face. Tally. “Addie was out and stole time from the littles.”

“Look, I know. I know. We’ll talk with Addie. This is all so hard to balance.”

“We have to learn.”

“I didn’t even want to be a parent.”

“But we are, and those little ones inside have so, so much patience for your bad parenting.”

Not gonna lie, even if this disorder is some elaborate psychodrama playing in my head, that one hurt.

“When’s the last time you put up the littles’ tent?”

I didn’t answer. She was already aware.

In the real world, I was facilitating a project management meeting. I looked alert, felt present, but my brain was a tangle of angry voices all screaming over one another to be heard.

“Right. Work. I’m getting Addie.”

My vision blurred and the world went dark.

### Addie, 10:03AM

I came to in the middle of my first work meeting. The scent of S’Mores Pop Tart wafted to my nose from a plate nearby. I didn’t remember we had those in the pantry, but I guess there goes my commitment to eating better breakfasts and losing some weight.

The world felt unreal and syrupy. The first two seconds after a switch always start with confusion. Either I can’t tell what day, month, or even year it is; or I can’t remember what I’m doing. There’s even a checklist for such an eventuality:

1. Scan the room for immediate danger.

2. Find a window to determine if it’s day or night.

3. If I’m in front of a computer, determine if I’m on my personal computer or on the work one.

4. Is there someone on a Zoom with me? If so, check the notes in the work folder.

5. Try to not act like a crazy person.

6. Blame your confusion on the weather, the day, or my sleep, whatever works.

My confused face showed on zoom and that spiked my anxiety to 11; did they watch me switch? Do they see it for what it is? Oh gosh, what if they all know I’m crazy and barely beginning to hold things together?

Potts’ voice echoed in my mind. “Relax. They probably see it. Remember we used to, like, assume that people saw every little detail on our face? Like, we never saw it because bad eyes, so we never learned the whole language of facial expressions enough to fake it—“

I did my best to ground. Thought about ice. Ran my finger over a braille stick. Something - anything - to keep me grounded. My head sounded like a coffee shop that had nothing but ticking clocks and anxious voices echoing around brick walls.

During all of this - all of this internal terror and drama and such - _I was still running the meeting._ My voice spoke, my hands danced across the keyboard, but I had no clue who is doing it. Lucy, maybe, based on the voice I was hearing in my head?

“Lucy, darling. Zoe wants some time to journal after your morning meetings. We kind of owe her after last night.”

I sent a thought back at her: “I mean, sure. I wish we’d keep this stuff outside of work hours though.”

Lucy shrugged. “We’re parents now, Addie. And we’re gonna be the best ones we can because they deserve it.”

“I know. I, just… yeah. Disability hard.”

“We know.”

Somehow, my body’s eyes rolled in response to the internal conversation. Shit. Now I’m eye-rolling on camera? Quick: scan the room for any sour faces or angry frowns, just in case I made another mistake.

Pay attention to the stuff people pay you for, Arcades. That’s priority one.

The call ended. My world was now fully dreamlike, and I swear to dog I could pass through walls if I cared a teensy bit less about physics. Through the haze I wrote a quick message to the team in my next meeting informing them that I had to step away for a headache.

Then: open Discord. Open up the right channel for Zoe to write in. Close Teams so that she won’t respond to messages. I took some deep breaths while double-checking the work setup to make sure it was kid-proof.

### Zoe, 10:10AM

(Pasted here from our system chat -Potts)

okay listen

hear me out

poptarts are really good, and s’mores poptarts were the best and I only got them sometimes

but they made me feel happy and safe when I didn’t feel safe at all so uh

can we just have them? I know I know addie is worried about weight

but not the poptarts

and i still want to play something tonight. I understand the marble game is boring so if you want to play video games with me instead that’s okay too. I just want to hang out and do fun things

ok bye

### Addie, 11:00AM

My head pulsed. This always happened when we got switchy. A pounding headache rumbled up from vertigo, amnesia, and confusion.

I ran the switching checklist once again before asking Zoe if I could read her entry. She said it was in the green book, and I knew immediately that that would wait until after work. Potts chimed in: “See? If you give the kids time their needs can be really small. Always give the littles what they need; they _will_ ruin your day to prove a point, if otherwise necessary.”

The next hour passed in a haze. Not a productive haze, either; this was more like one of those “stare into infinite space while your entire body refuses to move, respond, or even feel” kind of hazes. The kind that made Teams message chimes terrifying and every meeting a struggle to stay grounded.

We could hear D coming by their footsteps. They usually came up after their court call was done, mostly to check in and talk about lunch. But something about the way the footsteps fell, and the state we were in, and thinking about the book sent alarm bells ringing. Oh, fuck—

—fudge!

Okay. Hold on a second. There’s a little one with me now while I’m writing this part. Hello little one!. I don’t know who you are but you seem really nice and kind on the inside. I’ll let you pick a face and a name and tell me why you’re here, but first I have to set up some timers, okay?

I can feel my brain falling away from my control, but I’m taking deep, deep breaths to ground. I had to push the kid down for a few more moments, just to wrap up work. I looked to the calendar for my next meeting - a 1:00PM with my boss - and set a timer to wake me up at 12:45.

When that goes off, you have to let me come back, okay? We have adult responsibilities we have to do but I’m so, so glad to hear from you, kiddo!

That’s all the more encouragement it takes for the kid to take control. My eyes roll back into my skull and

### Addie, writing for a new little, 11:30AM

D’s melodic voice echoed through the hallway. “Hey Austen! Done with court! Still want to get lunch with-Oh!”

The second they turned the corner their expression changed. Gone were the daily worries, the troubles, the “adult stuff”; here they were bright and friendly, smiling, child-friendly. 

I spoke without thinking. “Hiiii I’m new and I’m little and I’m a little scared.”

“Nothing to be scared about, little one!” They clapped their hands in that way that makes kids giggle. My body giggled. “Is there anything you want to share?”

“No, I just wanted to be out and Addie said it’s okay for me to be out for lunch so I’m gonna watch some Chip and Dale and play games.”

I did _not_ okay that, mind you. Least, I don’t remember saying it. Things get hazy when you’re trying to work things out on the inside.

I’m… well. I’m trapped. The body is no longer my own, and whatever happens next is completely dependent on the kid driving the body in that moment. Scream, howl, scratch at the amnesia walls in my mind, but that lunch was to be property of this new little.

“Why am I here?”

An even bigger smile crossed D’s face. “You are safe and in 202X. You live in this condo with me, and those bad people can never, ever get to you again!”

“Cool.”

She walks to the window and opens it. The sound of a sea floods into the room along with a caucophony of road noise, ambulance sirens, and the bustling big city.

“Do you wanna see a big lake?”

I walked to the window and stared. Sure, my version of “the lake view” was a chisel-like opening between two buildings, where a smear of greenish-blue lake smeared all the way to the horizon. It wasn’t exactly exciting. But the sound? The force of water pounding the shore, the distant call of ducks raising their family in our little cove? They all sang a wonderful song for me that more than made up for my lack of vision.

“You never had a lake like this groing up, eh?”

“We went out to Raccoon Lake,” the kid said. “Back when dad bought a boat.”

“Well, this lake goes on past the horizon! It’s huge!” They gave my hair a tussle. “Do you want anything to eat? I’m sure you’re hungry because I’m hungry too!”

“Uh, yeah.” My voice is thin, reedy. _Scared. She’ll tell the others we’re here and then the guys will show up and_

“I’ll make anything you want.”

“Mac and cheese, please!”

“Okay!” They grabbed a green book from the shelf and handed it to me. “You hang tight and draw in your journal, and I’ll be right back!”

So I got some crayons and drew and drew and felt warm and safe until D returned with a kraft dinner with hotdogs cut into it. “Here you go, kiddo!”

“It’s okay if I eat in bed?”

“You can eat wherever you want! Nobody’s here to tell you otherwise!” They leaned in. “Would you like a forehead kiss, kiddo?”

“Yeah!”

They gave us the gentlest forehead kiss. They always give good kisses. “Fankoo for getting this for me.”

“Of course,” my wife replied. “Let me know if you need anything, kiddo!”


### Twi, 1:15PM

“I’m still not seeing the consistent progress I want to see.”

The voice was familiar but hazy. Authority? Boss. Boss! 

Last time I was out, it was noon on a Saturday. But here I was, sitting on a zoom call with no idea what was going on. Looking down, I saw a half-eaten bowl of mac and cheese, and an muted tablet playing Chip and Dale.

_The fuck is going on?_ I thought.

I scrambled through notes, looking for my list of “things to brag about.” There had to be something that was demonstrably better now than it was a few weeks ago, but honestly? I knew the decision was already made. I was a dead enby walking. I didn’t want to admit it yet but I knew the pattern because I’d been on the other side of the management fence before.

This was a mid-year performance review, triggered by an ADA process from my vision, and the verdict is in: I wasn’t improving enough to make the cut.

“I’m really sorry to drop this on you before a big vacation, but I wanted you to know what came out of the accommodation process. You’re still not where I need you to be.”

Inside, my body was a scramble of emotions. Terror. Fear of physical harm, if you believe it. Nausea. Vertigo. You name it, I was experiencing it. Outside, my eyes unfocused and my mouth fell slightly agape and _I want to let the world go fuzzy so the emotions stop hurting me—_

“I hope you have a great vacation, though!”

She was genuine. The news sucks but she was doing the best she can, so I smiled and waved and ended the call. Inside, I was a pile of crabs, all trying to climb to the top of the bucket to peer out on what just happened.


### Addie, 4:00PM

I came to without knowing where the day went.

There’s a beer by the work computer and I realize, to my horror, that I’m drinking during work hours. (Gotta love a good wagon fall on the company dime, I guess.) But honestly, nothing I did or say was going to make things better at work. Eseentially, my day ended before it started because I didn’t listen to the littles.

All around my office were half-finished tasks: drying loads of laundry, half-built lego structures, and the dulcet tones of a mascot professional wrestling league blaring from my computer speakers. Atop the work laptop was a green book with a sticky note: “NOT UNTIL AFTER WORK.”

Not that I needed a warning with the green book. I knew better.

This is how you survive as a mentally disabled person: you get long strings of being unable to focus at work, and then you hope for the 10x, 20x days where you have plenty of spoons to spend. When it happens, you push the accelerator to the floor, hoping to whoever will listen that the effort will get you a few weeks ahead before the bad times returned.

Like Twi said, once the board broke there was going to be a mighty mess to clean up.

I didn’t message any coworkers. Didn’t say goodbye. I just went downstairs, packed a bowl, and took a long, rough drag. Inside I could feel the others beating at the surface of my consciousness, demanding to have their say.

We were about to ride the rolodex.

For those who haven’t experienced it before, the rolodex is a state we wouldn’t wish on our worst enemy. For the next hour, we were going to rapidly cycle through alters, sometimes with as little as seconds between switches. Each switch brings with it complete amnesia, more dissociation, and confusion.

Essentially, picture giving an old rolodex a quick spin so it cycles through all your contacts, but it’s inside your brain.

Every single time the switch happened, we’d look to D and say “Hi, I am not well.” And they would give us a hug and explain, yet again, that the system wrote in the green book today.

I’m not well, indeed. This system stuff is for the fucking birds.


### Potts, 10:00PM

“I think I finally have control.”

I was on the couch with my wife. My eyes were moist - pillow, too, and my body was twisted to both be as fetal and as close to D as possible. A breath later, my shoulders relaxed.

“It’s an adult on this end,” I said.

“Mostly,” D said with a laugh.

“Oh hush. I’m grown now.” They were referring to last year, when I acted like a 9 year old boy. Lots of poop jokes, of course, care of our main subscriber Butthole Spas, where your number two is our number one priority. (You’re welcome, D!) But since that time, I’ve become sort of a system dad.

“Bad night?”

I shrugged. “I guess, yeah. Not like I can remember it.”

“Yeah.”

We were silent for a moment. On the coffee table was the green book from earlier, and inside were drawings of a naked child being held at knifepoint.

“I just… it’s hard to believe, D. Fucking terrifying.”

Their voice, calm and measured, relaxed me. “I’ve met the kids, hon. This is all real.”

“I just… yeah.” Addie shaded in to talk for a moment. “I’m just afraid of being this disabled. I feel like this is my last chance to have a career before I’m too disabled to get a job.”

“That’s not true.”

“I know. I just feel it.”  I tried to chuckle, but switching Addie back out was taking my all my concentration. “Fuck. I’m hungry. Did we get too high?”

“I didn’t pay attention.” This was D-speak for “You probably had more than you think because of your amnesia.” When I ask inside nobody can really tell me how much I’ve had.

“It’s 10, right? Did we eat dinner?”

“Yes.”

“Fuck it. I’ve got the munchies and am ordering delivery. If I’m gonna have to go out tonight with a flashback-brain I’m at least going out the way I want to: full of delicious steamed trash.” 

Steamed trash, in this case, represents of the greatest gifts the Midwest has ever given the world. Thousands have made pilgrimages here just to sample its heavenly, oniony aroma. It’s grandeur can be seen on the silver screens of the world, but truly, to know this, the True Face of God Arisen as Fast Food, you must journey to the middle of nowhere, USA and sidle up for a 10-sack.

I was talking, of course, about a big ass bag of White Castle sliders.

D laughed. “I’m out. How in the hell are you going to hit delivery?”

I raised an eyebrow. “Ordering enough to _get_ delivery is just one part of the challenge.”


### Addie, 8:00AM

I woke with a shot. Outside, birds sang and the tide washed in fresh seaglass from Lady Michigan. Inside, I felt like my stomach was demanding to speak to the manager.

“You should look at your phone,” my wife told me.

I stood - mostly because otherwise I’d puke - and made my way downstairs while looking at the photos presented for me. There, the remains of a feast of ten sliders, fries, and at least one mozzarella stick covered the coffee table.

The photos showed a veritable burger bouquet, with multiple types of sliders and a mini-buffet of different dips to try. The bastard had even pulled out our silly turkey serving plate to lay the burgers out all fancy-like, and he added balsamic drizzle for garnish.

_A balsamic drizzle._

“What day is it, D?”

“Saturday.”

I breathed deep - not too deep - and heaved a belch.

“What the fuck happened yesterday?” I asked, and D just laughed.
