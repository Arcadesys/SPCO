# Unemployment
## The year we had nothing to do

*After the managed-out year. We learned to actually live together. AI fixed our memory gaps. Time cured my disadvantage in blindness.*

---

### 5b.1 The end of the managed-out job
**POV:** Addie or Twi | **~600–1k words**

Last day or last conversation. Not dramatic—just over. The relief and the terror.

---

### 5b.2 First week without work
**POV:** Addie | **~800–1.2k words**

No structure. Who gets up? Who applies? Who dissociates? The fear of "we have to find a job" vs. "we have nothing to do but be us."

---

### 5b.3 AI as external memory (first time it really worked)
**POV:** Any | **~1–1.5k words**

Specific tool or workflow: daily log, "what did I do today?" prompt, shared notes that survive switches. The weirdness of reading your own life in third person.

---

### 5b.4 A day (or week) where we actually cooperated
**POV:** Potts or Addie | **~1.2–1.8k words**

One concrete day: who did what, how they handed off, one conflict and how it got resolved. "We learned to live together" in scene.

---

### 5b.5 Blindness: time, not cure
**POV:** Max or Twi | **~1–1.5k words**

No big event—the accumulation. Cane routine, VoiceOver default, asking for help without shame (or with less). "Time cured my disadvantage" = adaptation, not healing.

---

### 5b.6 D during unemployment
**POV:** Addie or Sam | **~800–1.2k words**

How D responded: fear, patience, boundaries. "We're not okay but we're not dying." One conversation or ritual.

---

### 5b.7 The job search that didn't save us
**POV:** Addie | **~600–1k words**

Ten resumes a day, or not. The market, the cane, the gaps. Maybe one interview that went wrong (or right and still didn't land).

---

### 5b.8 What we did instead of work
**POV:** Multiple | **~1–1.5k words**

Music, kids, arcade, meditation, nothing. The boredom and the gift of it. "We had time."

---

### 5b.9 Turning point: we're not going back to who we were
**POV:** Twi or Lilith | **~600–1k words**

A moment (or slow dawning) where the system accepts that the old career self is gone and that living together is the job now.

---

### 5b.10 Bridge to "for now"
**POV:** Addie | **~400–600 words**

Short. Unemployment ends (new job, or choice to stop chasing the old kind). The captain's wheel, the cabin, the grill—this is what came after.
