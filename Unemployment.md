# Unemployment
## The year we had nothing to do

*After the managed-out year. We learned to actually live together. AI fixed our memory gaps. Time cured my disadvantage in blindness.*

---

### 1. The lie

Write the layoff. Your boss lied to your face about what was happening. What did they say? What actually happened? The moment you knew it was a lie. The betrayal as the break between "managed-out job" and "nothing." Relief and terror both. ~800–1.2k words.

---

### 2. The first week

The job is gone. No structure. Who gets up? Who applies? Who dissociates? The fear of "we have to find a job" vs "we have nothing to do but be us." Set the void that the next six months will fill. POV: Addie. ~800–1.2k words.

---

### 3. Monk mode

You threw yourself into learning AI and software dev for six months. Like a monk with a mission, dialed in. You were also writing this book. Give concrete details: what you studied (AI, dev), when you wrote, how the days looked. One or two specific moments — a late night, a breakthrough, a routine. Not vague; this is the named phase. ~1.5–2.5k words.

---

### 4. AI as external memory

In that same six months, AI fixed our memory gaps. Pick one specific tool or workflow: daily log, "what did I do today?" prompt, shared notes that survive switches. What did you use? How did it feel to have a record that outlasted amnesia — the weirdness of reading your own life in third person? ~1–1.5k words.

---

### 5. Learning to live together

In the six months the only "project" besides AI, dev, and the book was being a system. One concrete day or week: who did what, how you handed off, one conflict and how it got resolved. "We learned to live together" in scene. POV: Potts or Addie. ~1.2–1.8k words.

---

### 6. Blindness: time, not cure

No big event — the accumulation. Cane routine, VoiceOver default, asking for help without shame (or with less). "Time cured my disadvantage" = adaptation, not healing. You had time to integrate it instead of performing abled at work. POV: Max or Twi. ~1–1.5k words.

---

### 7. D during the six months

How did D respond? Fear, patience, boundaries. "We're not okay but we're not dying." One conversation or ritual. POV: Addie or Sam. ~800–1.2k words.

---

### 8. First interview

You were handed a document the moment the interview began. No prep, no warning. A four-page, 12-point PDF of context. Your nightmare. And you were only allowed pen and paper — your worst enemy. Write the scene: what they handed you, what you could or couldn't do, how it felt. POV: Addie (or whoever fronted). ~600–1k words.

---

### 9. Second interview

An old friend put you up for the position. You told them you couldn't see well enough to do a test in normal time limits. They interviewed you, hired you. You're now in the best job of your life; you move the needle every day. Write it: the ask, the response, the hire, and what "best job / move the needle" means now. ~800–1.2k words.

---

### 10. Turning point / Bridge to "for now"

We're not going back to who we were. Living together (and the book, and the learning) is the job now. Unemployment ended. The captain's wheel, the cabin, the grill — this is what came after. POV: Addie or Twi. ~600–1k words.
