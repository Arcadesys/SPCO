# Lost in the Supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
a guaranteed personality

## Potts, 1992. age 8

What’s the best thing in the world? Don’t bother answering, because the best thing in the world is going to an arcade and that’s just facts.

And on this day, Uncle Justy took me to my favorite one in the world: Putt Putt’s Super Saturday special.

We came here me here when he spent time with me on the weekends. My sister would have gym meets sometimes, and my dad would be out of town, so a lot of times I spent Saturdays with Uncle J, and every Saturday, like clockwork, he’d take me here for an afternoon of gaming.

I skipped through the redemption games, slid past the fighting game crowd, and settled in front of the big pinball machines at the back. I’d play them without a stool, so that I was barely able to see what I was doing, but the sounds and sensations the game made were just so cool to not play. It reminded me of game show bells and whistles going off for a grand prize, the cool pinball song from Sesame Street, and bowling’s big crashing sounds all at once. Basically, my autistic heaven.

“Having fun?” Uncle J asks me. I gave him a huge smile and a nod.

He slid up by the machine and watched me play for a while, all smiles and nods. When I was done he handed me a small manila envelope full of tokens. “Tell you what. You take some of my tokens and try to get a high score?”

And as everyone knows, six year olds are easy to bribe as long as you have two things: copious amounts of sugar, or tokens in an arcade. I snapped up his tokens like a greedy little troll and played, played, played until I could play no more.


## Samantha, 1990, age 6

“She’s special,” Justy told mom and dad. Least that’s what mom says happened. “You need to challenge her. Give her room to explore things, stuff to take apart, activities to do.”

I was hearing about this in a meeting with my kindergarten teachers. I just read the entire first grade reading curriculum in a single night, after reading all the kindergarten books the night before. I’d received large print copies of every book at the start of the year in a giant ziploc bag and, well, I really liked to read. Not that those books were any good; I picked at the stapled, xeroxed copies of my books inside the bag and adjusted my red glasses.

“I like computers,” I said. And it was true; since I was two years old I sat on my dad’s lap and watched him work this strange glowing box. I kept asking what the words meant until, with enough guardrails, I could navigate DOS on my own. At 3. These kindergarten books were way easier than that.

One of the teachers handed me a normal sized book. “Can you read this one?”

“I can’t.”

The teacher looked to my parents. “That’s a sign we shouldn’t do anything—“

“I have to read my copy.” I took a minute to find the matching book from my own bag of stapled-together “books”, pulled it out, and proceeded to read through any book they pointed to.


For their part, the teachers treated at me like I’d grown three heads; shock, and then confusion. What do you do with a kindergartener who already reads at a first grade level?

I didn’t have many friends back then.


## Potts, 1992, age 8

I spent a lot of weekends with Uncle J. Like, so so many. My Aunt Y worked nights, so most weekends it was just me, him, and all the best games I could ask for.

I was, to put it lightly, in kid heaven.

He liked playing games just like I did, but for the most part he just liked to watch me play. Said I was good at it. I didn’t mind because then I got to play more and it felt good to be complimented by him.

He took me lots of places, too! I’d visit friends of his, and those friends were really nice to me and had really nice kids too. I think it was a church group or something but I didn’t care about church, I just liked hanging out with Justy.

Above everything else, Justy saw me. He listened when I was having trouble. He pushed my parents to be nicer to me. He got me into some cool summer camps for smart kids, and through those trips I got to learn about Magic the Gathering and D&D and cool nerdy stuff like that. I even tried writing a D&D game while I was in camp because I wanted to have as much fun as the kids at summer camp recess were playing, but I could never remember the name of the game they played.

His home was like a magical castle in my memory. Three stories! Table tennis in the basement! Air hockey! Bumper pool! Regular pool! And games - so so many games! Board games, Nintendo games, _Super Nintendo_ games, all because he helped kids in his church and at schools.

We would go over for a Super Bowl party every year, and no joke, kid-me would budget out my time to make sure I could play everything I wanted to play while I was there. Then he started having me over more often and I got to play with as many toys as I wanted for as long as I wanted, which was cool.


## Misty, 1991, age 7

I’m really bad at making friends. I feel like nobody likes me.

We had to do a bunch of testing in first grade and I remembered how embarrassing it was. My test was the size of my entire little desk, and as a result every kid in the room copied off me. That got me sent to a little study room to take the rest of the tests alone.

Lots of the kids didn’t seem to want to know me. I feel like I couldn’t talk to them, so I kept busy on my own. Mostly I’d play with the Commodore 64 in the hallway. And while everyone else was making friends I got whisked off to another grade to take english and math. So I didn’t know many kids, and I couldn’t seem to remember their faces anyways, but I was told to not bring that up because that was rude.

Uncle J, he introduced me to nicer kids. Kids like me, who were weird and smart and liked videogames too much and were polite to each other. He also knew people at the school and helped me meet some good kids who became good friends.

And sometimes he’d pull me out of school just to get ice cream, so that’s pretty cool too.


## Potts, 1997, age 9

My stepmother was yelling again.

“You slept with her, didn’t you? You _did!_ God damn it, I’m leaving!”

It was 11 PM on a Thursday and Dad had just gotten home. Some nights this meant a quiet, early night. I was in a bedroom with my stepbrother at the time, and had hoped that there wouldn’t be a fight tonight.

A breath. “The kids will hear you!”

I kept lying in bed. I tried to interrupt them, once, but the look in their eyes when I came up put the fear of the devil in me and I ran back to bed, never to try it again. Nowadays I try to not move; after getting caught trying to read during one of their late-night fights I got in a lot of trouble. Instead, I lay in bed, frozen, pretending to be asleep, because I was never sure when someone would barge into the room in the middle of the night for some reason.

At midnight, the drama began. Bang! Clash! Plates and glasses made contact with walls. Crash! Screech! I could hear the sound of skin making friction with skin as two humans tried to struggle only to separate and shout at each other from a distance outside the effective range of thrown plates and glasses. Their voices gave way to shrieks, snarls, spits. “That’s it! I’ve had it with you!”

“Would you stop? The kids are asleep.”

“We’re leaving!” The building shuddered under the weight of an adult bounding down the stairs. I shoved my head into the pillow and pretended to be asleep as my stepmom rounded the corner and threw the door open.

“Get up,” she commanded my stepbrother. He did so while my stepmother threw some of his clothes into a duffel bag. I pushed my head even harder into the pillow, trying my best to hide in the sheets so the crosshair wouldn’t land on me.

“I hope the bitch was worth it,” my stepmom said. I peeked out from under the covers just enough to catch my stepbrother, bleary-eyed, making his way to the front door in his pajamas.

And the thing I hate about myself? I didn’t offer any support. At all. I was just glad to not be the target this time, and that after my stepmom squealed the tires pulling out of the driveway there would be quiet once again.

I hate to admit this, but I don’t know how many times this happened. Certainly more than 10, less than 100. They all blurred into a single, terrifying moment for me, when I lay dead still under the covers and hoped that nobody would scream or hit me this time.

## Misty, 1993, age 9

I was special to Uncle J. Nobody else in the family got the treatment I did. My sister? Nothing. Cousins? Not likely. But me? I was smart and I was special and he took care of me. He never yelled at me, never pushed me to answer, never hit me. He was just nice.

And the thing that he was _really_ good at was listening and participating. Like one time, I wanted to learn how to play table tennis because him and dad played a lot, and when I asked he didn't just tell me to figure it out. He took the time to teach me every little shot, and gave me tips on how to practice. He was really, really good at teaching me things!  

He also had a really fancy new computer with a cd rom drive. I got to play The Seventh Guest on his lap while he watched and gave me hints on the puzzles. And he came up with cool projects to do too! We'd take walks and bike rides and he'd show me cool new places like museums and stuff.

And when I was feeling like it he'd let me play a lot of his video games without asking for a turn. Or better, sometimes he played games with me!

When I was in his guest bedroom I felt safe. There weren't people screaming. Nobody would come in drunk to explain why they just had a fight. I could close my eyes and listen to the frogs and crickets as the gentle sound of the midwest lulled me to sleep. Unforgettable.

Then my dad did something bad to his wife and we stopped talking for a long long time.


## Potts, 2021, age 9

I didn’t grow up from being nine for a really, really long time.

Quick context: we’d just discovered our system three months ago. D is Pagan and I was, well, complicated, so we settled on celebrating the Pagan holidays. That day we were making a roast, D was making fruitcake, and then we had a pile of presents I had picked out for the system with D.

Yeah, I bought Christmas gifts for the alters. Funny thing is I was able to make every gift a surprise by simply forcing myself to forget what was in each box.

Things weren’t off to a good start that night: we had already lost a potted plant, a wine glass, and two pint glasses. Each time my body seized up into a little ball and the past became present. Inside, terror and fear roared, insisting that the front door would open and out would spill some parent, probably drunk, ready to tear into me.

We tried to calm down enough to eat the fruitcake D prepared, but the smell of burning alcohol triggered someone else inside to a point that we couldn't eat a bite. So that's fun, you know, randomly being incapable of doing normal things like eat food.

But gods, D was just a _saint_ about it. Each time we fell out, they would come running with an ice pack to return me to reality. And then I'd apologize, and they'd tell me to stop apologizing, until we were stuck in a Midwest Nice Doom Loop of polite conversation.

The night ended well, though; in our trauma-tinged dissociation we sat on the sofa and retreated back to the arcade inside. It was oddly full for the moment: seemed like there were dozens of kids running underfoot, all playing pinball, or tag, or whatever racing game was in the back room.

"Doing okay, Champ?" It was Twi doing the talking. He waved me over to the bar and I joined him for a root beer.

"This is a lot to handle," I said, looking at all the kids.

"We'll get used to it." Twi said, shrugging. "Or not."

"I just don't get why there's so many!"  

"We're excellent compartmentalizers," Twi responded with a wink. "Look how far we made it before we started making contact with each other. Remember how scared we were of failing? Of falling behind?"

"Yeah! It was stupid and I hated it. I'd be having lots of fun making a song or something and then you'd get afraid that I wasn't perfect enough."

Twi's brow furrowed. One of the kids - a ghost, for all intents and purposes - smacked him on the leg. "Tag!" He shouted, and then flew away. The other kids giggled. Me too, honestly. I would have given chase to the kid but Twi? Twi's all business when he's focused on something.

"I hope my past actions are water under the bridge.”

"Yeah!" I patted the top of his hand. "You got it, friendo. You were just trying to keep us safe, I know that now. But still, there's a lot of these kids. I don't know how we're gonna manage!"

"Would help to have a good babysitter for them all."

He forced eye contact with me and flashed a toothy smile.

“No.” I shook my head. “I’m not a babysitter. I'm a kid!"

"Yeah. A growing kid who is ready for more responsibility." He leaned in closer to whisper: "Listen, you know I'm bad with kids. Addie too. We could use someone like you. Someone who gets the kid experience."

"A teacher?"

Twi laughed. "Yeah. A teacher. But you have to teach by doing, okay? Learn how to make them feel safe with us."

"I could do that. Oh!" I forced the world to come back into focus. The arcade disappeared, replaced with my condo's comfy couch and a pile of presents. Twi and I were still *there,* in a matter of speaking, controlling the body like it was some sort of Voltron. 

Twi found himself holding a wrapped gift. “So surprise, I bought presents with D. This one's for you!"

Twi and I tried our best to control the body together. Usually it wasn’t a big deal, but sometimes what we want didn’t quite match up with what the body was doing and that's because we aren't on the same page inside. But this time, the little imp had no problem picking up the small package and tearing it open.

He almost dropped it in shock when he saw it: a simple paring knife from IKEA.

"I don't know if it's any good, but anything's better than us using that knife you tried to kill us with. It's not okay that you haven't replaced it yet."  

"I didn’t want to forget it,” Twi said. “We’ve done too much forgetting. It’s time to sit with who I really am—“

"We forgive you," I said, and felt a hundred voices nod in agreement inside. "You were doing the best you could. And besides, because of that scare you found us!"

"Thank you," Twi said. Then I felt a pat on my knee.

“I’ll leave you all to talk,” D said, and then I was back in the arcade, shaking hands with every little creature I could see.

## Misty, 2011, age 9

I met Uncle J once as an adult, even though I was still a kid on the inside. We were at a family reunion at a homestead separated from the world by a long, gravel road. I’d been invited by my stepmother as a sort of peace offering.

It was awkward, to say the least. I was a few months into hormone replacement therapy and very obviously Not Passing. Few people in the family bothered to talk to me, and I only ended up staying an hour or two before noping out.

But on the way out I saw Uncle J leaning on a wooden fence. He was watching kids play in the field. I hadn’t seen him since… gosh, since my dad broke his relationship with him a decade or so before. (Something involving extramarital sex, I think.) But there he was, a little greyer and a little more aloof, but he was still the uncle who saw me. The uncle who cared enough to help. The uncle who spoiled me like a princess.

And there, in the middle of nowhere, we met eyes. Or at least I tried to; he looked right past me.

I tried to make small talk. “Hey there, Uncle J. How’s life?”

He deigned to meet my eyes when I talked. “I don’t agree with it.”

Just like that.

“Okay, well I’m happy and I figured you’d like to know that.”

“Yeah. Got it.”

Have you ever felt like a discarded condom? Because there, in that moment, the one uncle who had been my rock simply didn’t perceive my existence. I felt small, limp, and full of gross juices in that moment.

I’ll never forget how low I felt in that moment, watching my favorite uncle in the world toss me aside like a little rubber sleeve that was no longer useful. But hey, that’s what being trans is like. People can get really shitty about it and they’re allowed to, and I have to turn the other cheek and let them abuse me.

Honestly, I was used to it.


## Potts, 2023, age 38

It didn't happen overnight - growing up, that is.

System age is hard to explain to singlets. It's like, uh, so imagine you're reading a book, right? And you're not sure what age the protagonist is because it never gets said out loud. So you listen to the context, you know? Decisions they make. Things they like. Values they hold dear. Things that you pick up real quick when an alter comes up and demands a stuffed animal, you know?

So how did I grow up? It happened piece by piece as I helped babysit those little kids. I worked with meditation to build them a comfortable, safe place inside the world.

In fact, let’s take a look at one of these little kiddos right now! This is Samantha. She presented as a ghost and had spent years in what she calls “the Dark Place” in our head. When she was found, I guided her to a large park outside the arcade by the smell of a campfire that never gets smoky and the sound of children playing in a giant treehouse.

Yes, there’s lots of them. No, it doesn’t bother me anymore. Used to; made us feel a little hopeless that we’d ever heal. But for now, the kids are just that - kids who need love and support to heal. 

Each new kid came covered in filth and Samantha was no different. She was covered in muck and mud and caked-on sweat when I got a hold of her, so first order of business was to pull out a wet rag. “Come on over here, kiddo,” I said in the gentlest voice I could. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”

I dabbed the sweat and grime from her brow with a gentle smile. “See? No strings attached here. I just want to help. The past is over now, kid. You’re so so safe now!”

Samantha shied away from my hand at first. “I did terrible things and I’m sorry I’m sorry–”

“Hey, hey! None of that.” I wrapped her up in my arms. “You’re safe now. You did really good, holding onto whatever you have! And now you get to play with all your newfriends in here.

“And if I want to do things in the real world?”

“We can make that happen too!” I shot finger-guns her way. “We have so many kid nights, girl. You’re gonna be happy here.”

Not mentioned to Samantha was the fact that I’d just climbed a three story ladder to break into my house because of her.

See, my wife and I went out for dinner without knowing that Samantha had locked all the doors in the house to feel a little safer. Needless to say it was a shock to come home to a house locked up in a way we weren’t used to, and having forgotten our keys I had to scramble up a ladder and shimmy into our third story condo window.

I’m sure we’ll laugh about it at some point in the future, but in that moment I was ever so slightly angry about it. Not that I was going to take that out on Samantha; she didn’t know any better. “I promise you’re okay, honey. Even if we had to shimmy through a window!”

“I’m a kid in a big body,” Samantha said. “I don’t fit in anymore.”

“Hey.” I took her by both shoulders until she met my eye. “You fit. You matter. More than anything in our world right now, even!”

“Really?”

“Honest honest.” I held out a pinky. “I’ll take a pinky swear on it. Anytime you want to be out in the body, we’re gonna find time for you to play. And we’ll buy you toys: legos, coloring books, dolls, whatever you want!”

“Misty said we didn’t have a lot of girly things.” Samantha said. “But it was a long time ago.”

“Yeah. Great news for you there.” I pushed away from her, did a twirl, and pointed to the arcade. “We live in Chicago now and we became a girl like, fifteen years ago. Being a girl is old news now.”

“You’re kidding!” She cracked a grin but paused before continuing. “But what about you, Potts? You’re a guy.”

“It’s complicated,” I said, shrugging. “But come on, let’s get you a good shower and a fresh look. Sound good?”

“Yeah!” A small shower stall with a locking door appeared from thin air, already hot and steamy and cozy for the little girl. While she busied herself with that I went about imagining a wardrobe full of magical clothing for her to try on.

We learned the tip from “Coping with Trauma-Related Dissociation.” It’s a mediation technique where you offer your little parts clothing that will, for example, render them invincible, or make them invisible, or even cause some people to never be able to talk to us. As they make picks, I take notes on what they chose and try to note places in our life where some change would make the kid more comfortable. Honestly, the stuff these kids ask for shocks me: pants that can’t come off, invisibility cloaks, sharp teeth to bite probing tongues.

I tried my best to not think about the details. Not now. Not yet. Make the kids feel safe, and ask hard questions later.

“Do you know any other kids back there?” I asked.

She shouted over the shower. “A few. They’ll come eventually.”

“Cool.”

While she took a bath I ran to the treehouse and told the others about Samantha. They all agreed to make her feel safe and comfortable inside and set about making a welcome party for her.

Again, this was all happening in my mind. It’s… well, it’s hard to explain to a singlet. The world inside my brain has state, with noticeable landmarks and familiar corridors I crossed in my dreams. The arcade was just the interface when we’re awake, and if we put our minds to it we could shape the world to our will.

Once upon a time, this space was bleak and inky-black with dark, black tar. It took months for us to build out a space for the kiddos outside, and that only came after a few sick days to recover from the resulting PTSD episodes.

When she came out she was wearing a cute bathing suit. That was one of the rules inside; no nudity, no matter what. Some of the kids even hated looking at our own body without clothes on.

I pointed to the wardrobe. “Take your pick.”

The wardrobe gave way to an entire clothing store in hyperspace, the likes of which still makes no sense to us. But she traipsed around the ailes, found some bunny ears and a pink dress, and emerged a tiny little white bunny with a screwdriver and a bunch of electronics.

Just like that, Samantha knew she was safe and I knew how to solder again.

It’s impossible to explain but our skills are split between different alters. We’re never sure when we’ll be able to do things we’ve spent years practicing. For example, we grew up learning how to code but forgot for about 20 years because the alter who learned went dormant. As they come back online, the skills come back to us.

And so it goes, one child after another, slowly being nudged toward the present in the gentlest, most loving way we could manage. Be the one who helps the kids for long enough, you grow up. Find all the kids, and eventually you can heal into a single personality. Simple as that, right?

Gods, I wish it were that simple. But we try, and we struggle, and sometimes we persevere. Best of all, every child we find brings back some wonder to our life. The kid who learned piano, for example. Or the kid who knew how to draw decently. Or the kid who dances - we love the kid who dances for bringing that back to us!

Little by little, alter by alter, we will grow up through this. Anything short of that, and the abusers win.


## Sam(antha), 2023, 9 going on 39

All I ever wanted was to get the princess treatment.

I remembered this apartment complex from a long time ago. Where it is isn’t important. My sister and I would spend weekends there and hang out with our new stepsisters. They used to be close family friends but now they were part of the family, and that’s really rad.

But they also are all girls, so sometimes I didn’t get invited to play. Like when they played dolls, or watched girl shows, or did each others’ makeup. That’s when I had to keep myself busy, usually with videogames. But I wished like hell I could have been girly just like them!

I asked the system if I could go to the Ren Faire in mid-2022, and they all agreed. I felt… silly about it, really. The adults didn’t like the idea of a kid running around in our body in public. But I said I’d act like an adult, and with enough begging and pleading they let me take the day. So I put on the prettiest, whitest, frilliest dress we had, packed a bag of toys, and we drove to the Ren Faire to hang with friends.

On the drive there I shared the story of that apartment with D and they didn’t skip a beat in responding. “We can give you a Princess Day, Lucy. If that’s all that stood in your way before, that’s easy to fix!”

“Really!”

“I love when the system challenges are easy,” D said

Bristol Renaissance Faire was, at that time, the largest freestanding faire in the US. Worn dirt paths wove their way through rows of low-slung cottages, all selling time-appropriate clothing, crafts, and favors. There was even a legit joust at the end of every day, which was super exciting!

We met up with some friends in the faire. Before that I had laid eyes on a parasol and D just bought it for me like it was nothing! So I was smiling and spinning that little parasol like the princess I wanted to be while we greeted our friends.

“This is Samantha,” D explained. “She’s 9, and she gets to be spoiled today.”

My friends nodded in agreement, and from that point forward I was just a kid in their care.

Over the course of the day I purchased (and changed into) a completely new outfit. D bought me a circle of flowers for my head, a cute crop top, a wrap skirt, and some really pretty earrings and a necklace. I flounced, skipped, and bounded around the faire without a care in the world.

Because my friends - my family! - just loved me as I was. No anger at me acting weird. No mean words when I did something embarrassing. They gave their love freely, no strings attached, in a way i hadn’t experienced before. Kindness, affection, and genuine love overtook ancient fears, and for the first time in my life as an alter I got to enjoy myself.

Gosh, the things we did! Archery, for one, even though I couldn’t see. I got in a fight with the town quartermaster, meditated with the town healer, and bought a giant turkey leg. There were jugglers and comedians and it was all so much fun to do.

And then we got to watch a joust! Seriously, if you haven’t seen a joust before you should. They’re so cool! And the sound a wood lance makes when broken on armor is super cool.

It was after that joust, when we were walking back to the car, that D noticed it. “You’re not skipping anymore,” they noted.

“Guess I’m tired,” I replied. “It was a long day of walking, after all. This outfit sure is fun! I’m so glad you let me splurge here.”

“You’re still Samantha, right?”

“I think so, yeah.”

D’s leaned closer. “You sound older.”

“Huh.” I asked inside about my age. Everyone shrugged. “Ask me.”

“What?”

“How old I am. Ask me!”

“Okay, I’ll bite.”

“I am 38 fucking years old.” I said, smiling. “Finally, I caught up with the body.”

“Wow! That’s impressive.”

We drove in silence for a while. Not for lack of conversation, mind you; there was plenty to discuss after a day at the faire. Instead, I was busy talking inside.

“Happy birthday,” Addie said. Inside, we sat at a table near bar, where pint glasses on the bar rocked back and forth in time with the sway of the car. It was only her there this time; the others respected my wish to have the day to myself, and the only reason Addie hung around was to jump in if I fell out.

I sat down at Addie’s table, laughing. “I guess this does this count as a birthday, doesn’t it?”

I looked down at myself and saw my body. Not the form I usually took inside the head: a large, plus size rabbit-girl. Instead I was there, visibily human, and I wasn’t sure if I was a kid dreaming I was an adult, or an adult waking from a child’s dream.

“You did really good, Lucy, and now you get to grow up. Congratulations.”

I felt the pull of sadness on my heart. “Thanks. But, uh.”

“What?”

“She’s never coming back, is she?”

“Who?”

“You know. Mom.”

Addie shook her head. “I know you miss her. We all do. But what’s done is done. She didn’t like us being a girl.”

“That’s stupid.”

Addie pointed at me. “Little of that 9 year old poking out still.”

“Oh, yeah.” I sat with it for a moment. “I’m just sad.”

“I know.” Addie put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sad too. But with time, you’ll learn what happened between us. It’s not pretty.”

“I got that idea.”

Snap. We’re back in the car. I think… Right. D was talking.

“So? How does it feel to be old?”

“Comfortable,” I said with a smile. “Thank you, D, for babysitting me today.”

“Anytime,” D said, and then thankfully put on music so that I could go back inside and talk with the others about my miraculous transition to emotional adulthood.


## Sam, 2024, age 40

Right, uh, memoir stuff. Hi! The others asked me to contribute to this project so I wrote a this. I'm Samantha. And Misty, and Lucy, and a whole host of other girls who are sexual assault survivors that banded together to form a new alter. You may have seen me contributing to the memoir project in other parts of the narrative under different names. Turns out system shake-ups turn everything upside down.

That's what we call 'em, at least. System shakeups. We'll hit some life milestone, or process some deep trauma, and our internal world gets thrown into a tizzy. What comes out the other end is... still me, technically. Still "us," still a collection of alters. But our skills, our demeanor, our everything else? You might as well roll a fresh set of alters and toss out what you thought you knew.

You have to understand that there's around 400 distinct parts inside this brain at all times, swimming around in an amnesia soup because of things that were done to us as children. When we grow, parts of our selves move to other parts of ourselves, taking with them their memories and their skills. The resulting alters are pastiches and we have to figure out who can do what all over again.

I can't tell you how exhausting it is.  To not know what day it is, what time it is, what I was just doing two seconds ago. To find half-done tasks someone inside started but didn't finish. To excusing yourself from a party you're enjoying because some kid inside wants to hump the air and scream into a pillow. To being treated like a _literal fucking child_ because you are temporarily not able to make decisions for yourself.

So why wouldn't we try to pretend that things are better? Why would we want to be connected to who we really are inside, when that person is just a pile of miserable little alters? 

For now, I'm a bit more connected to the inside than I was before, and that's a good feeling. The more we come together, the fewer gaps in time we feel. The more we push our healing, the less our system symptoms get in the way.

But still, deep down in our heart of hearts, we know that our brain's totally broken beyond the point of repair. And it scares the fucking crap out of us to think about it.


## Max, 2023, age 18

...oh wow I type so differently now lol

I really thought hypergirly Samantha name was going to stick didn't I lol

everything Sam said basically, but for the kids inside and me. I am the one who puts on Zoobilee Zoo, the one that packs the stuffie when we go on road trips, the one who makes sure we give kids time ❤️

and i know it is hard but the kids deserve to be heard and that's super important

Also fuck our mom ig  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
