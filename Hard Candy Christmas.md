## Twi, 2021

A week at compass comprised of twelve sessions of group therapy, five meditation sessions, and two individual sessions with a primary therapist. Ours was named Laurie, and let me tell you, she blew our mind near the end of the program. See, Laurie is an expert in dissociative disorders and child sexual abuse, and she was about to talk to Zoe without an adult present.

(…God, the strangeness of this never gets old. What in the world am I saying? “Without an adult present”? What does that even mean? No wonder I’m so fucked up—)

Addie, stop. Remember, Boundaries.

So I sat in group therapy, ready to name my emotions and my current mood level, when Laurie opened the door. We had planned this out earlier in the week after a really bad flashback; try as we might, the kids refused to talk unless the adults gave up the front entirely.

The idea terrified us. Zoe blocked us out completely whenever the flashbacks happened, as if trying to hold back a tidal wave on her own. Letting go of the relative security and safety of ignorance was, well, much like diving off a cliff and hoping the cove below had enough water to catch you.

Playing pretend at this disorder was fun while it lasted in Seattle. Sure, I pretended to be a kid back then because I got attention, obviously. But things are different now. there are *stakes*. We have to be certain that this system thing is real. That these memories aren’t, like, psychosis or hallucinations or smoking too much weed or something and—

And…

…And you know what, Addie, fine. You want to control the script, you write this part.

## Addie, 2021

I didn’t mean to—

…shit. Okay, I deserved that. Back when I was at Compass I wanted any excuse to avoid admitting the system existed. To say that I acted like a jerk to the system is an understatement.

Yes, I know this is silly. (We had even started writing this book at that point, so there was a *mountain* of evidence proving the system’s existence, but I digress.) But the one thing in this world I feared most was accepting Zoe’s truth.

If she wasn’t an alter, I was simply making up a tall tale about having a system.

If the system didn’t exist, the trauma wasn’t real.

If the trauma wasn’t real, the problem was completely internal, and therefore my fault. I’m hallucinating to get attention.

If I was hallucinating, I could continue to ignore that horrible things like that actually happen to People Like Me. It was destitute children from other countries being held in, I don’t know, a drug warehouse or something, someplace remote where I didn’t have to think about adults molesting children as a real, concrete thing that could happen to a person.

“Did you bring him?” Laurie asked. I jumped; the voices inside were so loud that I could barely hear her. But she stayed there in that moment with me, gentle voice and empathizing eyes, until I regrounded.

I pulled Jack-Jack from the backpack with a bit of a frown; a child inside was angry that we hadn’t let his head out of the pack so he could breathe. I heard a few heads turn as I cuddled the stuffie tight to my chest and followed Laurie to her office. The less I thought about what they were thinking, the better.

I imagined everyone staring at me at that moment, a plus-size woman in her late thirties clutching a stuffie and rocking with it like a child. They’d remember this, and I’d never live it down-

Right. Grounding. Exhaling, I released the stuffie from my bear hug and joined Laurie in the hallway.

“I’m nervous,” I said.

“Don’t worry. I prepared the space for her. Come inside.”

What was once a muted, dim therapy office with tastefully nerdy decorations had been transformed into a pediatric therapy room. Sensory jars filled with pink glitter and green slime tempted me from a side table. A pile of coloring books sat on an adjoining chair, complete with bright markers for coloring. I took a seat in the same chair I always chose and I swear to you, the chair was two sizes larger in that moment.

She readied her notepad and pen while I settled in.

“Nerves getting better?”

“A bit. Feeling silly, more than anything. But Misty keeps insisting I try. The alternative is more of, well, this *mess*.”

“Addie, I take it?”

“Ha,” I said, shaking my head in disbelief. “You’re good at that.”

“Addie, we’ve talked about this. It’s completely normal for systems to have little parts.”

“I know.” I picked up a sensory jar and twirled it. “And I’ve met them. They’re sweet. It’s just… I don’t like letting them out consciously, if that makes sense?”

She nodded. “Okay, Addie. Everything’s going to be okay. All of this is in the past and it can’t hurt you. The kid just wants to tell their story.”

“That’s not the hard part. It’s, uh,” my eyes darted to the floor.

“You’re safe.”

“I’m not used to uh, feeling little. Vulnerable. In need of protecting, you know? And especially around strangers, no offense.”

“This is what you came here for,” she reminded us. “To listen to them. To let their story be told. And you’re doing a really brave thing to listen to the others.”

“Yeah. Right, okay. Right.” I took a deep breath and tried to, well, blink out of existence. There wasn’t a good way to explain the sensation of trying to crawl out of your own body so that someone else could take control.

“You okay?”

“Uh, fine. Performance anxiety.” I could feel my cheeks flush with the childlike desire to play hard to get, to encourage an adult to see me and talk to me and make me feel safe.

I pursed my lips and concentrated. Nothing happened. I looked to her for a favor.

“Uh, it helps if you call her out.”

“Can I talk to Zoe?” Laurie asked, and I blacked out.
 

## Twi, 2021

Addie and I were cast out of consciousness and into a dark abyss.

We’re… nowhere, I guess. Picture a dead mall with the lights off. The smell of dust and musty piping filled the air. We were everywhere; we were nowhere; and in the core of it all was an angry, hissing *thing* that lived in the decrepit pit.

A dim projector played what looked like grainy home video against the white shutters of a closed store. In the image was a large church basement with wood paneling. Cameras and studio lights drowned the space in blindingly bright light and the air of an official studio.

A single figure stood behind the projector, shifty and shadowy. It was an angry pencil sketch that resembled a child, its face shifting and hissing with the flip of paper, the scratch of graphite, and sobbing. It shambled toward us with long, lurching steps, and when it opened its mouth a long, low hissing tone came forth to fill us with dread.

Above us I saw the real world, but it’s distorted. Like I was looking up through the thin skin of a drum and from there I could barely make out the therapist’s office. If I craned my ears I could hear the sound of a woman talking to what seems to be a small child. When I tried to scream out for help, though, nothing happened.

“The fuck is that?” Addie asked.

“It looks sharp and very, very painful,” I replied. “We should avoid it.”

The animated scribble continued its march toward us. The projector clicked through different scenes. Suburban home basement. A trailer by a creek. The church, again. Each image filled me with dread.

I could hear the scribble sharpening itself as it came closer, its jagged edges honed into light, tight, smooth-slicing killing machines. Addie scrambled for cover in panic, trying to find a weapon to defend herself.

I tried to be brave for the system. “Hey, we’re all friends here,” I started, but as I said that the scribble lashed out and left a long, then cut on my chin. I stumbled back and it lurched forward, sometimes at a crawl and sometimes at a dead sprint, its hissing now resembling a growling, a snarling, a cornered dog pockmarked with pustules and engorged ticks, its eyes alight with the will to live, its muscles giving out—

Lilith’s voice chirped in on the intercom. “Don’t run, you dummies. Remember what Laurie said: this can’t hurt you! Just listen, like we listened to you both!”

So I relaxed just like they taught me to do in therapy groups. Eyes closed, mind open, as the scared sketch charged at me with all its might, teeth bared, its eyes firmly affixed on the my jugular, and I leaned back so it could have a better shot at my throat.

“Do what you have to,” I said, and the sketch paused with its hashings brushing my neck.

## Zoe

The nice lady sat me down and gave me some markers. I got to color outside of the lines because I’m allowed to do that now and nobody yells at me for being a terrible artist.
 
Then I knocked over the markers and she got up and I thought I was gonna get hit so I balled up but she didn’t do that. Instead, she cooed kind words at me while she cleaned the markers from the floor.

“Accidents happen,” she said with a smile. “And that’s okay! Nobody’s gonna hurt you here.”

“Really?”  

“Not a one!” She smiled. “And nobody can get in here, either. Ask the others, they’ll tell you that you’re safe with me.”

I asked.

I got a warm fuzzy feeling so I let myself smile.

“I’m Zoe,” I said.

“I’m Laurie,” she responded in a sing-song voice. “Can you tell me more about what’s on your mind? I promise to keep a secret if you ask me to.”

“No I want them to know.”

“Is there a reason you haven’t told them yet?”

“I dunno. I was scared I’d hurt them. They didn’t like thinking about bad things.”

I kept coloring. I liked to color. Laurie had really really good markers too. So I colored for a bit and played the quiet game and Laurie gave me time to color and it was nice for a while. She told me I could play with any toy I wanted but she gave me a tiny little coloring book with fun animals in it, and I wanted to draw the bird in the middle of the book in super silly colors.

Laurie flipped a page on her notebook and pulled out a pen. “Okay kiddo. Tell me what happened.”

## Twi, 2021 (CW Intense CSA)

Around me, the mall gave way to liminal space. I sailed on a turbulent lake covered in liquid nitrogen. Then: a cosmic flush, a great gurgling sound that swallowed the dark, the dawn, the celestial bears. I smelled fresh corn silk perfumed with cow shit on late country nights. My non-body flowed with stardust and sewage through a black hole that pulled and pulled until my atoms gave way to Higgs bosons—

When the ride stopped I was looking at a living room from my past. I was visibly myself again, and for a moment I wasn’t sure if I was the cosmos or if I was Twi, witnessing something so horrendous that it had been locked away for 30 years.

I was staring into a living room where a man and a child were watching a movie. Someone had scribbled over the face of the man and the child in my memory. In fact, everything in the room, from the color of the sofa to the pile of the carpet, feels like it’s just… deleted from my memory. There’s a laserdisc player on top of a giant rear-projection TV. They’re watching, uh, a Disney movie I think. Something with a cat.

The scribble reappeared, waved, and took his place on the couch. Frosty glass separated us, giving the whole scene a veneer of unreality.

Addie reappeared by my side and we watched as the child waited patiently on the couch, alone.

“Want to know something weird?” Addie asked.

“Hit me.”

“I feel like I’m on the other side of this glass. Like, I know this memory isn’t mine, but I remember everything about it. The way his couch was really cozy, and how he had a big sound system and a laserdisc player. But here I am, sitting on the outside looking in.”

“It is our memory,” I corrected her.

“Yeah.” She looked away. “Just wanted to try avoiding it one more time.”

The scribble was joined by an adult on the couch. He sat close to the scribble, slung his arm around the scribble, and pointed to the TV. “Want to sit on my lap and watch a movie?”

“Yeah!”

The scribble, Addie, and myself all said it in unison. I felt like a puppet on strings as I was lifted up, up, high above the glassy amnesia wall, until I was in the living room myself.

“You here too?” Addie asked.

“I think so.”

“I don’t trust this.”

“We know it’s going to suck,” I said. If Addie and I weren’t in the same body I would have given her a hug. “But that’s going to have to be okay.”

We felt small in the moment. Excited to please the nice guy on the couch. He’s nice to me, and he spends lots of time showing me movies and playing games.

Sitting in his lap feet weird. He had a weird, uh, _thing_ that moved when I sat on him. I tried to sit on one of his legs instead of over the, uh, thing, but every time I do he puts me back right in the center.

“We can watch your favorite movie,” he whispered in my ear. It made me feel special and loved, even if the thing in his pants made me feel funny.

“Hey, let’s play pretend. You be a kitty, and I’ll give you lots and lots of pets! Sound fun?”

“Yeah! I like cats! Meow!” I mimicked the movements of a kitty, toddling on all fours and pretending to clean my face. He started petting me like a cat: first on my head and then back and belly and then his hands went down down down—

## Samantha, 2021

“Did he touch you?”

The others wanted me to think really, REALLY carefully before answering but i nodded. “Yeah. He touched me a lot.”

I kept coloring. Coloring meant I could answer honestly because the others were too busy paying attention to the lines and remembering things to stop me.

“Did you know the man?”

“Yeah.” I described him. “Moustache. Gray. He’s nice to me.”

“Was your father involved?”

And I wanted to say it then but you were all so scared and I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t

## Twi, 2021

The scenery changed faster and faster. A mall portrait studio. A suburban house. The mall, a trailer. My childhood bedroom. He, or someone like him, is always there. They use me like a toy while other guys watch and I don’t like it, I don’t like it—

Blink. I was eight years old and in my old elementary school. I had been called to the front office because 

Uncle J was picking me up that day for a fun field trip, just him and me. He can do that because he’s friends with the teachers and they trust him a lot.

“I just need to take him to a service appointment, miss.” He was lying through his teeth, I knew. Part of me was happy he got to pull me out whenever. And he’d take me out of school to do fun things sometimes. But I felt my stomach turn and a voice inside wanted to scream at the secretary to the nice lady in the front office “don’t don’t don’t please don’t make me go.”

I felt myself choking on a long, thick, member all the way down my throat.

The blurry memories kicked into clear focus. His hand on my lap in the car. The friends he shared me with. The house parties he took me to. The filmmakers—

No.

It wasn’t supposed to be me. It was Samantha. She was the one who had to live through it. This isn’t what we agreed on, everyone! We were supposed to learn about it, not live through it!

“We wanted to forget this for so, so long,” Lilith said. “I’m so sorry.”

I wanted to puke. I would have, had I any control of the body, but the scribble held me there, like was a puppy being shamed for an accident. It pushed my nose closer, closer, until the elementary school gave way to a church rectory late at night. There were men, cameras, and lighting there.

I laid on a shag rug in a church basement, surrounded by wood paneling, smoky yellow lights, and the off-gassing of drunk men. There were two little girls there with me. It doesn’t feel like me but every time I think that the sketch hisses harder and honestly I don’t want to tell it no. I’m not sure what it’s capable of.

The girls and I were on the carpet, and if I looked under the scribbles I can tell we’re—

No…We were naked, and touching each other.

The cameraman nodded at me. “Do it. Touch her. Show her a good time—“

## Samantha, 2021

I kept shaking and wanting to run but the nice lady kept telling me that I was safe. Potts has to keep telling me where and when I am.

I did this to us. I was the one that knew I’d stop getting special treatment if I didn’t go along with it and I liked it, okay? I liked being special to someone. I knew it was wrong but I touched those little girls. I let those men have sex with me and I had a relationship with one of them because they were the nicest one and didn’t hurt us when he raped us.

I traded it all away because Uncle J loved me, and I wanted to make him happy so I could keep seeing him. I’m sorry I let everyone down…

*I was on my knees and I pretended to be a girl. There were men above me with thier penises in their hands and I’m supposed to bat at those like a little kitty who wants cream—“*

“There’s so so SO many kids in here, Laurie! They shattered into hundreds of pieces so that the adults could never, ever learn—“

*I watched a scared, naked young girl in a cage. In the back room, there was a girl screaming in pain and I can’t do anything about it because I’m going to be next and if I yell they hit me and make it hurt more—“*


“It’s too much!”

“It’s okay, sweetie. You don’t have to talk anymore. I’m proud of you.”

“I’m not in trouble, am I?”

I made sure Addie and Twi could see the sadness in Laurie’s eyes.

“You’re not in trouble, sweetie. You did great!”

## Misty, 2021

I was in Laurie's chair with no clue how I got there.

From the looks of her full notebook we had just wrapped up a session. Did I miss something? My head was foggy, as if I had just come back from a nap. I gave the room a quick once-over to retrace my steps and noticed the coloring book on my lap. Coloring book? I *hated* coloring!

I laughed - when I'm nervous and disoriented my first reaction is always to laugh - and tried to shift my weight around.
 
My muscles ached. I had gigantic knots in my shoulders from too much tension, stiffness in legs wound tighter than clock springs, and tears. So, so many tears.
 
Laurie handed me a slip of paper and a tissue box while I got my bearings.

"That was Samantha. She asked for some things during our session: markers, ice cream, and a marble run set. I promised her I'd hand the note to the adults when we were done talking."
 
"Wait. I thought we just started our session!"
 
"We've been here for 90 minutes, Misty. You probably don't remember."
 
"Sorry," I said on reflex. Sorry was my default state most days. Sorry to have taken up space, sorry to have bothered you, sorry to have taken time off work because couldn’t be trusted to not kill myself.

If anything, sorry was easier than admitting how crackers and crayons crazy I was in that moment. From the outside I must have looked absolutely looney: a grown woman brings a stuffed animal to group therapy, disappears into a room, and regresses into a literal child that colored and remembered and—
 
”Say thank you."

Laurie’s sharp voice pulled me back to the real world.

“What?”
 
“To Samantha,” she continued. “Thank her. Spoil her tonight. She’s very brave to have shown up today.”
 
I felt my heart race, my vision blur.

"It's okay. Stay here with me, okay? You're safe."
 
I took a deep breath and tried to stretch. I felt cool as a cucumber, despite experiencing feelings of intense terror and shock. I cycled through the two emotions so quickly that I got to feeling nauseous.

“Close your eyes, Misty. Breathe for me.”

I did. The room came into focus, though my stomach wasn’t settled. “I guess she told you a lot, by the look of that notebook."

“Do you want to know?”

“I have to,” I said after a hard swallow.
 
She leaned back into her chair and folded her hands in her lap. Silence. She adjusted her glasses, met my eye, and laid me low with the truth:

“Samantha remembers being taken from school to be raped by other adults. You were groomed, trained, and then used.”
 
My breath caught in my throat. Another chuckle. "Okay. So, pretty bad then."

She leaned closer to me. “What you did was not your fault and was never your fault. These groups survive by discretion. You're only invited in if you're known, vetted, and provide material. Videos, pictures, or in some cases, children to abuse."
 
"That's not possible."
 
"Samantha has no reason to lie."
 
"I just..."
 
"I know this is hard--"
 
"I don't remember any of this."
 
She sighed. “You know you have amnesia barriers, Misty.”

"Who did it?"
 
“Your uncle.”

A dozen fragmented images danced across my memory. Each one contained a flashbulb of a weekend with him: a trip to the arcade, then a night alone at his house, where we’d play games together—“

“Hey, Stay with me here. You’re safe. None of the people who hurt you know where you are right now.”

I picked up a sensory jar from the table beside me and gave it a shake and did some shape breathing. I hated this part of having DID; whenever we got overwhelmed we had to stop everything and ground. Made us like a fainting goat, sometimes.

“Back?”

“Yes,” I said. “Thank you.”

I kept breathing and counting seconds: in for two, hold for two, out for two. In, hold, out. I felt the panic in my head calm down.

“Did my parents know?"
 
Her face hardened.

"Probably. It would be extremely unlikely for something like this to happen without some signs appearing here and there. Many times, in situations like this, parents are in on it or know about it in some way or another.”

That’s all it took to get the tears rolling.

I started crying like I had never cried before. It felt like someone had shoved a shiv deep into my heart, and the tears bled forth until they became streams, streams into rivers. I imagined crying infinite tears into an endless ocean that covered everything it touched with filth, shame, and guilt.

Laurie just waited while I drained an ocean of pain, offering reassurance from her chair. “I’m so, so sorry for what happened to you. It's wrong and should never have happened. But you can care for those kids now. You can help them heal."
 
I heard the implied message under her kind, unoffensive words: "And if you want to get better, you're going to have to share your life with them.”

## Samantha, 2021

it was our uncle justy okay

he took me out of school sometimes he made me do house calls

and on weekends he took me to a rotating party where the adults would make me do awful things and they liked when i screamed

There i said it

happy now

## Addie, 2024

You know, in a way I was a perfect victim.

Neglected and abused by family to the point of being love-starved and desperate? Check. Dissociated to the point of forgetting where I was from time to time? Check.

And most importantly, I was literally blind to the men and women who raped me, so even if I did remember I couldn’t get a positive ID if I tried.

I hate his guts, but Uncle J was nothing if not smart. If you get one thing from this book, remember this: pedophile networks are filled with smart people who, above all else, _never want to be caught_.

And out in the sticks, where law enforcement is thin and social support networks are frayed, they could get away with almost anything their heart desired.

Fuck, man. We’ve been caged. Choked on dicks more times than we can count. Threatened with a knife to the throat to keep our rapists’ secrets safe. Hell, we were forced to film child porn with two girls, all of us naked and writhing on the shag carpet of a Sunday school classroom.

I wish I could remember their names, their faces, literally anything about them. Because we cared for each other, and we supported each other as the endless line of johns raped us without a care in the world, safe in the knowledge that they’d never be caught.

## Lilith, 2021

…Fuck, we almost wrote a heartfelt letter to Uncle J when he was on his deathbed. He died before I learned about the abuse, but still. Fuck! I would have been so pissed had my last words to him been “thank you so much for all that you did for me.”

Fuck pedophiles. I hope the afterlife is a thing so they can suffer for what they did to us.

## Twi, 2021

On the last day of Compass I had a discharge session with Laurie. We’d spent the past few weeks talking about what happened; namely, I kept trying to convince myself that this couldn’t have happened, and Laurie would calmly explain how wrong I was. Eventually I came to a grudging acceptance of what happened: my once-favorite uncle used his position and his standing in the community to sell my body for sex.

Mostly, I was angry. Angry that my “close” hometown allowed something like this to happen. Angry that nobody in my blood family believed me. Angry that I was almost 40 and had to spend the past three months of my life in therapy. Angry - and honestly, just sort of *sad* - that evil like this actually existed in the world, and that my disorder was incontrovertible proof of its existence.

Angry at the thought of child pornography existing with my body in it, that I was some creep’s spank bank material and nothing more-

I paused, and took a deep breath. “Sorry, Laurie,” I said, pointing to my head. “Noisy inside today.”

“You’re okay!

But something else brewed inside me, and on that final session I said the words out loud:

“Laurie, I don’t want to die anymore.”

She stopped taking notes for a moment to meet my eye. “What makes you say that?”

“I’ve always wanted to die,” I continued. “Never knew why. But now, I guess, I know what caused me to want that, and I know that this isn’t how I want to beat them.”

“Beat them?”

“Messy phrase, I guess. I’m thinking of narrative therapy here, and figuring out what this means to me. Did I get that right?”

“Pretty on point,” Laurie said.

“Before, I thought dying was the way to finally make them see my pain. That maybe if I killed myself my family would finally believe what I told them as a child. But now? Knowing what all those monsters did to me? Laurie, I don’t just want to live. I want to spite those fuckers. I want to fix my life. I want to have hobbies again. I want to feel joy, fun, love.”

“And your friends and family?”

“I’m still scared,” I admitted. “Opening up seems really scary. If they know things about my past, they can use those facts to hurt me.”

“Do you think they will?”

“It has happened in the past,” I replied. “With my transness, my blindness, my faith, my trauma. You name it, I’ve opened up about it and faced the wrath of my abusers. Even in Chicago stuff still finds its way to their home, and if I give them the chance they’ll get their claws into my new family and ruin it too.”

“Do you really think your friends would believe your parents over you? After all they’ve seen, and all they’ve experienced alongside you for the past ten years?”

“Honestly? No. They don’t care enough about me anymore to do cruelty. But the kids inside still think about it a lot. I… Well, *we* ruminate on it a lot.”

I looked to the ground. Laurie pointed her pen in my direction. “I appreciate the honesty,” she said.

My fingers traced idle circles in the therapy chair. “What if I tell people about this and they show up at my doorstep, demanding I change my story?”

“Have they ever?”

“No,” I admitted. Breathe. We’re not being chased by a tiger; we’re in a safe therapy room. Practice the skills. “I guess I worry. It’s one thing to say they were bad parents. But this? This is a lot, Laurie. Nuclear-level revelations.”

“Yes, they are. And you should be prepared for whatever they feel they need to do to protect themselves. Nobody wants to be painted as a child molester, Twi.”

“That makes sense.”

“I’ve worked on both sides of the bars on this,” she continued. “With victims and perpetrators both. And the perpetrators know the stakes. That’s why these rings are so well organized, and they know how to, well, ‘process’ a kid to make them easier to abuse without discovery.

“It’s a wicked business, and they ensure silence by demanding every new member bring material or kids so they also have skin in the game. But that’s all to say, the last thing your family will want to do is touch this history.”

I chuckled. “That’s kind of comforting, actually. Never thought I’d say that about CSA.”

“The tiniest silver lining! Right, I’m quoting that in your safety plan: ‘live for spite.’ What about the kids?”

“I’ll buy them more toys and make space for them to have their own experiences. It’s hard, and I feel really silly about doing it in front of others. But I’ll try.”

“Good.” She paused for a moment. “I want you to know, I’m *proud* of you. You’ve something extremely hard and should feel some pride for that.”

Having a safe, well, “adult” say that made the kids inside beam with pride.

“Thank you,” I said, holding back some tears. “It means a lot coming from you.”

## Lilith, 2025

Looking back, the silliest part of my suicide attempt is that we almost died over a bad karaoke song and too many McChickens.

No, seriously. We were working at one of those pre-pandemic tech startups that offered free booze and lots of activities in the office. One Thursday after work a bunch of us stayed at the office to get drunk and play karaoke.

We thought about leaving early to avoid the happy hour, but then people insisted that we have a drink, and one became two, two became four, and karaoke happened, and... well. You know. Drunk people order 200 bucks of McDonalds on the corporate card and ruin their diets to sate their drunk needs. If nothing else, the death poem would have been hilarious:

> > Too drunk and too sadened;
> > While my friends sing “Aladdin”
> > and eat McChicken,
> > In Lady Michigan my life will be stricken.

I almost killed myself over nothing. _Nothing_.

We aren’t proud of this. In fact, it may be one of the worst nights of our lives. But it’s the first time we knew that we wanted to live, and it’s the first time we talked to each other. So here we are, mentioning it in the book, because we promise you, this memoir is going to show warts and all.
