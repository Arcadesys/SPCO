- **Prompt:** Revise the "perfect job / 20 days" beat. The post-reassignment role was in a non-meaningful area; you were managed out over ~a year after the heights at Arity. Reflect: placed elsewhere → year of being managed out → then unemployment.
- [ ]

---

## 5b. Unemployment arc (~10k total)

*After the managed-out year. New chapter or new scene file: "Unemployment" / "The year we had nothing to do."*

### 5b.1 The lie
- **Words:** 800–1.2k

- [ ]

### 5b.2 The first week
- **POV:** Addie | **Words:** 800–1.2k
- **Prompt:** The job is gone. No structure. Who gets up? Who applies? Who dissociates? The fear of "we have to find a job" vs "we have nothing to do but be us." Set the void that the next six months will fill.
- [ ]

### 5b.3 Monk mode
- **Words:** 1.5–2.5k
- **Prompt:** You threw yourself into learning AI and software dev for six months. Like a monk with a mission, dialed in. You were also writing this book. Give concrete details: what you studied (AI, dev), when you wrote, how the days looked. One or two specific moments — a late night, a breakthrough, a routine. Not vague; this is the named phase.
- [ ]

### 5b.4 AI as external memory
- **Words:** 1–1.5k
- **Prompt:** In that same six months, AI fixed our memory gaps. Pick one specific tool or workflow: daily log, "what did I do today?" prompt, shared notes that survive switches. What did you use? How did it feel to have a record that outlasted amnesia — the weirdness of reading your own life in third person?
- [ ]

### 5b.5 Learning to live together
- **POV:** Potts or Addie | **Words:** 1.2–1.8k
- **Prompt:** In the six months the only "project" besides AI, dev, and the book was being a system. One concrete day or week: who did what, how you handed off, one conflict and how it got resolved. "We learned to live together" in scene.
- [ ]

### 5b.6 Blindness: time, not cure
- **POV:** Max or Twi | **Words:** 1–1.5k
- **Prompt:** No big event — the accumulation. Cane routine, VoiceOver default, asking for help without shame (or with less). "Time cured my disadvantage" = adaptation, not healing. You had time to integrate it instead of performing abled at work.
- [ ]

### 5b.7 D during the six months
- **POV:** Addie or Sam | **Words:** 800–1.2k
- **Prompt:** How did D respond? Fear, patience, boundaries. "We're not okay but we're not dying." One conversation or ritual.
- [ ]

### 5b.8 First interview
- **POV:** Addie (or whoever fronted) | **Words:** 600–1k
- **Prompt:** You were handed a document the moment the interview began. No prep, no warning. A four-page, 12-point PDF of context. Your nightmare. And you were only allowed pen and paper — your worst enemy. Write the scene: what they handed you, what you could or couldn't do, how it felt.
- [ ]

### 5b.9 Second interview
- **Words:** 800–1.2k
- **Prompt:** An old friend put you up for the position. You told them you couldn't see well enough to do a test in normal time limits. They interviewed you, hired you. You're now in the best job of your life; you move the needle every day. Write it: the ask, the response, the hire, and what "best job / move the needle" means now.
- [ ]

### 5b.10 Turning point / Bridge to "for now"
- **POV:** Addie or Twi | **Words:** 600–1k
- **Prompt:** We're not going back to who we were. Living together (and the book, and the learning) is the job now. Unemployment ended. The captain's wheel, the cabin, the grill — this is what came after.
- [ ]
